# Datasets
A collection of datasets to illustrate the export capabilities of the tools and software described in this repository.

As you might have found out for yourself already, file formats are not created equal. Many of them are not standardised, allowing for unnecessary confusion in importing and exporting your work. That is why we are collecting these datasets and information here in an open repository...

...to work together as a community and work towards a common understanding of file formats in the field of scientific review. Effectively, to work towards a standardised future.

In case you are interested in supporting the effort, please refer to our [guide for contributing](#contributing).


## Baseline
Below, you can find the baseline files which should represent the file as close to the official specific standard as possible. *[Description of the file formats](#file-formats)*.

| Format | Baseline |
| --- | --- |
| CSV | [_baseline.csv](CSV/_baseline.csv) |
| RIS | [_baseline.ris](CSV/_baseline.ris) |
| TSV | [_baseline.tsv](CSV/_baseline.tsv) |
| XLSX | [_baseline.xlsx](CSV/_baseline.xlsx) |

## Exporting
Below, you can find a list of files which has been exported from a specific tool or software *(e.g **[asreview.csv](CSV/asreview.csv)** represents a CSV which has been exported from ASReview)*.

| Format | ASReview | ... | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSV | asreview.csv | |
| RIS | WORK IN PROGRESS | |
| TSV | asreview.tsv | |
| XLSX | asreview.xlsx | |

## Importing
It is difficult to represent specific import capabilities of a given software from the perspective of a file format. But we will try to give you some highlights anyway!

| Format | ASReview | ... | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSV | asreview.csv | |
| RIS | [WORK IN PROGRESS](https://github.com/asreview/asreview/issues/495) | |
| TSV | asreview.tsv | |
| XLSX | asreview.xlsx | |
