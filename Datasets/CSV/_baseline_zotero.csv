This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA statement. PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS and Web of Science electronic databases were systematically searched from their inception to November 1, 2011. Using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, two blinded reviewers selected articles. Critical appraisal ranked the retrieved articles according to relevance and validity by means of the QUADAS-2 criteria. Pooled data of homogeneous study results estimated the sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). 18F-DOPA PET was superior in distinguishing focal from diffuse CHI (summary DOR, 73.2) compared to PVS (summary DOR, 23.5) and ASVS (summary DOR, 4.3). Furthermore, it localized focal CHI in the pancreas more accurately than PVS and ASVS (pooled accuracy, 0.82 vs. 0.76, and 0.64, respectively). Important limitations comprised the inclusion of studies with small sample sizes, high probability of bias and heterogeneity among their results. Studies with small sample sizes and high probability of bias tended to overestimate the diagnostic accuracy. This systematic review and meta-analysis found evidence for the superiority of 18F-DOPA PET in diagnosing and localizing focal CHI in patients requiring surgery for this disease.","2012-07-03","2021-12-15 07:13:01","2021-12-15 07:13:01","","97-105","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands Publisher: Springer New York","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://paperity.org/p/8646823/the-value-of-radiologic-interventions-and-18f-dopa-pet-in-diagnosing-and-localizing-focal; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11307-012-0572-0/fulltext.html; https://core.ac.uk/display/81100392; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11307-012-0572-0.pdf; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/22752652; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22752652/; https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11307-012-0572-0; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22752652; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11307-012-0572-0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In mucosal head and neck cancer (HNC), experience with ECT is limited due to the poor accessibility of tumors. In order to review the experience with ECT in mucosal HNC, we undertook a systematic review of the literature. In 22 articles, published between 1998 and 2020, 16 studies with 164 patients were described. Curative and palliative intent treatment were given to 36 (22%) and 128 patients (78%), respectively. The majority of tumors were squamous cell carcinomas (79.3%) and located in the oral cavity (62.8%). In the curative intent group, complete response after one ECT treatment was achieved in 80.5% of the patients, and in the palliative intent group, the objective (complete and partial) response rate was 73.1% (31.2% and 41.9%). No serious adverse events were reported during or soon after ECT and late effects were rare (19 events in 17 patients). The quality-of-life assessments did not show a significant deterioration at 12 months post-ECT. Provided these preliminary data are confirmed in randomized controlled trials, ECT may be an interesting treatment option in selected patients with HNC not amenable to standard local treatment.","2021-03-12","2021-12-15 07:13:01","2021-12-15 07:13:01","","1254","","6","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","; ; ; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7999968; https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7999968; https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/13/6/1254/pdf; https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/13/6/1254","electrochemotherapy; head and neck cancer; quality of life; systematic review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the significant number of studies observing the DMS, no collective evidence is available about the effect of all devices. Goal To review and consolidate evidences from multiple systematic reviews on the diabetes monitoring systems and the outcomes achieved. Materials and methods Internet-based search in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane was performed to identify all studies relevant to the research question. The data regarding type of intervention, type of diabetes mellitus, type of study, change in clinical parameter(s), or another relevant outcome were extracted and summarized. Results Thirty-three out of 1,495 initially identified studies, involving more than 44,100 patients with Type 1, Type 2, or gestational diabetes for real-time or retrospective Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGMS), Sensor Augmented Pump Therapy (SAPT), Self-monitoring Blood Glucose (SMBG), Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM), Closed-loop systems and telemonitoring, were included. Most of the studies observed small nominal effectiveness of DMS. In total 11 systematic reviews and 15 meta-analyses, with most focusing on patients with Type 1 diabetes (10 and 6, respectively), reported a reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels from 0.17 to 0.70% after use of DMS. Conclusion Current systematic review of already published systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggests that no statistically significant difference exists between the values of HbA1c as a result of application of any type of DMS. The changes in HbA1c values, number and frequency of hypoglycemic episodes, and time in glucose range are the most valuable for assessing the appropriateness and effectiveness of DMS. Future more comprehensive studies assessing the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and comparative effectiveness of DMS are needed to stratify them for the most suitable diabetes patients' subgroups.","2021-03-16","2021-12-15 07:13:01","2021-12-15 07:13:01","","636959-636959","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A.","","; ; ; ; ","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33796074/; https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC8008960; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8008960; https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2021.636959/full; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33796074","systematic review; diabetes; diabetes monitoring systems; glucose control; personalized approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this systematic review is to study whether sex disparities exist in the assessment of cardiovascular risk factors and screening for diabetes-related complications. Methods PubMed was systematically searched up to April 2020, followed by manual reference screening and citations checks (snowballing) using Google Scholar. Observational studies were included if they reported on the assessment of cardiovascular risk factors (HbA1c, lipids, blood pressure, smoking status, or BMI) and/or screening for nephropathy, retinopathy, or performance of feet examinations, in men and women with diabetes separately. Studies adjusting their analyses for at least age, or when age was considered as a covariable but left out from the final analyses for various reasons (i.e. backward selection), were included for qualitative analyses. No meta-analyses were planned because substantial heterogeneity between studies was expected. A modified Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort studies was used to assess risk of bias. Results Overall, 81 studies were included. The majority of the included studies were from Europe or North America (84%).The number of individuals per study ranged from 200 to 3,135,019 and data were extracted from various data sources in a variety of settings. Screening rates varied considerably across studies. For example, screening rates for retinopathy ranged from 13% to 90%, with half the studies reporting screening rates less than 50%. Mixed findings were found regarding the presence, magnitude, and direction of sex disparities with regard to the assessment of cardiovascular risk factors and screening for diabetes-related complications, with some evidence suggesting that women, compared with men, may be more likely to receive retinopathy screening and less likely to receive foot exams. Conclusion Overall, no consistent pattern favoring men or women was found with regard to the assessment of cardiovascular risk factors and screening for diabetes-related complications, and screening rates can be improved for both sexes.","2021-03-30","2021-12-15 07:13:01","2021-12-15 07:13:01","","617902-617902","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A.","","; ; ; ; ","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33859615/; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33859615; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33859615; https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/en/publications/sex-disparities-in-cardiovascular-risk-factor-assessment-and-scre; https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2021.617902/full","systematic review; diabetes; diabetes-related complications; healthcare provision; risk factors; screening; sex disparities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reported ADC values of benign and malignant lesions were compared per organ. The mean quality score of the reviewed articles was 50%. Comparison of ADC values showed marked variation among studies and between benign and malignant lesions in various organs. In several organs, such as breast, liver, and uterus, ADC values discriminated well between benign and malignant lesions. In other organs, such as the salivary glands, thyroid, and pancreas, ADCs were not significantly different between benign and malignant lesions. The potential utility of ADC measurement for the characterisation of tumours differs per organ. Future well-designed studies are required before ADC measurements can be recommended for the differentiation of benign and malignant lesions.

Wearables and smartphone applications offer new opportunities to change physical activity behaviour. This systematic review summarizes the evidence regarding the effect of wearables and smartphone applications on promoting physical activity. PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched for RCTs, published since January 2008, on wearables and smartphone applications to promote physical activity. Studies were excluded when the study population consisted of children or adolescents, the intervention did not promote physical activity or comprised a minor part of the intervention, or the intervention was Internet-based and not accessible by smartphone. Risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane collaboration tool. The primary outcome was changed in physical activity level. Meta-analyses were performed to assess the pooled effect on (moderate-to-vigorous) physical activity in minutes per day and daily step count. Eighteen RCTs were included. Use of wearables and smartphone applications led to a small to moderate increase in physical activity in minutes per day (SMD = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.03 to 0.82; I2 = 85%) and a moderate increase in daily step count (SMD = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.12 to 0.91; I2 = 90%). When removing studies with an unclear or high risk of bias, intervention effects improved and statistical heterogeneity was removed. This meta-analysis showed a small to moderate effect of physical activity interventions comprising wearables and smartphone applications on physical activity. Hence, wearables and smartphone applications are likely to bring new opportunities in delivering tailored interventions to increase levels of physical activity.","2018-09-03","2021-12-15 07:13:01","2021-12-15 07:13:01","","42-42","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30178072; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Ascholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl%3Aitem_2971586; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30178072/; https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-018-0157-9; http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/371715; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40798-018-0157-9.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6120856; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40798-018-0157-9; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30178072; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40798-018-0157-9/figures/5","Physical activity; Smartphone applications; Wearables","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to investigate the quality of HRQoL reporting over time. PubMed, CENTRAL and EMBASE were searched for RCTs concerning systemic treatment for advanced esophagogastric cancer up to February 2017. The Minimum Standard Checklist for Evaluating HRQoL Outcomes in Cancer Clinical Trials was used to rate the quality of HRQoL reporting. Univariate and multivariate generalized linear regression analysis was used to investigate factors affecting the quality of reporting over time. In total, 37 original RCTs (N = 10,887 patients) were included. The quality of reporting was classified as ‘very limited’ in 4 studies (11%), ‘limited’ in 24 studies (65%), and ‘probably robust’ in 9 studies (24%). HRQoL reporting did not improve over time, and it did not improve following the publication of the CONSORT-PRO statement in 2013. The publication of HRQoL findings in a separate article and second-line treatment were associated with better reporting. HRQoL reporting in RCTs concerning palliative systemic therapy for advanced esophagogastric cancer is limited and has not improved over time.

The PubMed/MEDLINE database was searched for relevant original studies. Included studies were methodologically assessed, and their results were extracted and descriptively analyzed. Three studies on the prognostic value of interim FDG-PET and eight studies on the prognostic value of end-of-treatment FDG-PET were included. Overall, studies were of poor methodological quality. In addition, there was incomplete reporting of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) data by several studies, and none of the studies incorporated the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) in the OS analyses. Two studies reported no significant difference in PFS between interim FDG-PET positive and negative patients, whereas one study reported a significant difference in PFS between the two groups. Two studies reported no significant difference in OS between interim FDG-PET positive and negative patients. Five studies reported end-of-treatment FDG-PET positive patients to have a significantly worse PFS than end-of-treatment FDG-PET negative patients, and one study reported a non-significant trend towards a worse PFS for end-of-treatment FDG-PET positive patients. Three studies reported end-of-treatment FDG-PET positive patients to have a significantly worse OS than end-of-treatment FDG-PET negative patients.

Study Design and Setting This study used a sample of 100 systematic reviews published by the Cochrane Musculoskeletal, Oral, Skin and Sensory Network between 2014 and 2019. Results We identified 2,000 trials (369,778 participants) from a sample of 100 systematic reviews. The median year of trial publication was 2007. Of 1,177 trials published in 2005 or later, a clinical trial registration record was identified for 368 (31%). Of these registered trials, 135 (37%) were registered prospectively and results were posted for 114 (31%); most registered trials evaluated pharmaceutical interventions (62%). Of trials published in the last 10 years, the proportion of registered trials increased to 38% (261 of 682). Conclusion Although some improvement in clinical trial registration has been observed in recent years, the proportion of registered clinical trials included in recently published systematic reviews remains less than desirable. Prospective clinical trial registration provides an essential role in assessing the risk of bias and judging the quality of evidence in systematic reviews of intervention safety and effectiveness.","2020-12-14","2021-12-15 07:13:02","2021-12-15 07:13:02","","79-87","","","132","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands Publisher: Elsevier USA","","; ; ","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33333165/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0895435620312208; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435620312208","Randomized controlled trial; Systematic review; Evidence synthesis; Trial registration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To inform the development of recommendations, we sought to critically assess the systematic review evidence on the effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of AIT for ARC. Methods: We undertook a systematic overview, which involved searching nine international biomedical databases from inception to October 31, 2015. Studies were independently screened by two reviewers against pre-defined eligibility criteria and critically appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Systematic Review Checklist for systematic reviews. Data were descriptively synthesized. Results: Our searches yielded a total of 5932 potentially eligible studies, from which 17 systematic reviews met our inclusion criteria. Eight of these were judged to be of high, five moderate and three low quality. These reviews suggested that, in carefully selected patients, subcutaneous (SCIT) and sublingual (SLIT) immunotherapy resulted in significant reductions in symptom scores and medication requirements. Serious adverse outcomes were rare for both SCIT and SLIT. Two systematic reviews reported some evidence of potential cost savings associated with use of SCIT and SLIT. Conclusions: We found moderate-to-strong evidence that SCIT and SLIT can, in appropriately selected patients, reduce symptoms and medication requirements in patients with ARC with reassuring safety data. This evidence does however need to be interpreted with caution, particularly given the heterogeneity in the populations, allergens and protocols studied . There is a lack of data on the relative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and safety of SCIT and SLIT. We are now systematically reviewing all the primary studies, including recent evidence that has not been incorporated into the published systematic reviews.","2017-08-08","2021-12-15 07:13:02","2021-12-15 07:13:02","","24-24","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: BioMed Central","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/46989412/Allergen_immunotherapy_for_allergic_rhinoconjunctivitis_a_systematic_overview_of_systematic_reviews.pdf; http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/356415; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28794855/; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13601-017-0159-6; https://lirias.kuleuven.be/1187608; https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/allergen-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-a-systema; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28794855; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5547534; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13601-017-0159-6.pdf; https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/103898/; https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/allergen-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis(aca296e6-92f6-4077-8db7-9137cc887809).html; https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/46989412/Allergen_immunotherapy_for_allergic_rhinoconjunctivitis_a_systematic_overview_of_systematic_reviews.pdf; https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/allergen-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-a-systema-2; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28794855; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/28794855; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepub.eur.nl%3A101320; https://core.ac.uk/display/154412648; https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/1874/356415/1/s13601_017_0159_6.pdf; http://orca.cf.ac.uk/103898/; https://ctajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13601-017-0159-6; https://repub.eur.nl/pub/101320; https://repub.eur.nl/pub/101320/REPUB_101320-OA.pdf; https://core.ac.uk/download/97016012.pdf","Allergen immunotherapy; Allergic rhinitis; Allergic rhinoconjuctivitis; Allergy; Hay fever; Rhinitis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to identify and systematically review available evidence for the diagnostic value of signs, symptoms, and additional tests to diagnose pneumonia in children in an ambulatory setting in developed countries. We conducted a systematic review, searching in the electronic databases of PubMed and Embase. Quality assessment of studies was done using the QUADAS-2 criteria. After data extraction from selected studies, we calculated and summarized test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values) of all available signs, symptoms, additional laboratory tests, and chest ultrasonography. The original search yielded 4665 records, of which 17 articles were eligible for analysis: 12 studies on signs and symptoms, 4 on additional laboratory tests, and 6 on ultrasonography. All included studies were performed in a secondary care setting. Risk of bias was present in the majority of studies in the domain of patient selection. Prevalence of pneumonia varied from 3.4% to 71.7%. The diagnostic value of the available 27 individual signs and symptoms to identify pneumonia was low. In a low prevalence setting, (4 studies, pneumonia prevalence 10%), additional diagnostic tests such as oxygen saturation, C-reactive protein, and white blood cell count are more promising. Chest ultrasonography showed high diagnostic value in settings with higher prevalence of pneumonia. Single signs and symptoms from medical history and physical examination or individual additional diagnostic tests are insufficient to diagnose pneumonia in ambulant children. Very few diagnostic studies are conducted in settings with low prevalence of pneumonia. Future research in low prevalence settings should focus on the diagnostic value of the combination of clinical features and additional testing possibly using meta-analysis of individual data.","2018-10-26","2021-12-15 07:13:02","2021-12-15 07:13:02","","40-40","","1","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Acris.maastrichtuniversity.nl%3Apublications%2Fca058201-014d-4d84-b308-59e03c197393; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41533-018-0104-8.pdf; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6203790; https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/1874/372984/1/s41533_018_0104_8.pdf; http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/372984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6203790; http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6203790; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41533-018-0104-8/; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30367067/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective of review The objective of this systematic review was to compare performance in paediatric cochlear implant users with SNHL caused by cCMV compared to non-cCMV implantees. Type of review Systematic review SEARCH STRATEGY: PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane databases were searched from inception up to 15 May 2017 for children, cochlear implant, performance and their synonyms. Evaluation methods Titles, abstracts and full texts were screened for eligibility. Directness of evidence and risk of bias were assessed. From the included studies, study characteristics and outcome data (speech perception, speech production, receptive language and auditory performance of cCMV groups and non-cCMV groups) were extracted. Results A total of 5280 unique articles were screened of which 28 were eligible for critical appraisal. After critical appraisal, 12 studies remained for data extraction. Seven of 12 studies showed worse performance after cochlear implantation in cCMV children compared to non-cCMV children. Worse performance in cCMV children was attributed to cCMV-related comorbidities in six of these studies. Available data on asymptomatic cCMV children compared to non-cCMV children did not reveal an unfavourable effect on cochlear implant performance. Conclusions The available evidence reveals that cCMV children often have worse cochlear implant performance compared to non-cCMV children, which can be attributed to cCMV related comorbidities. We urge physicians to take into account the cCMV related comorbidities in the counselling of paediatric CI users deafened by cCMV.","2018-06-19","2021-12-15 07:13:02","2021-12-15 07:13:02","","1283-1295","","5","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell","","; ; ; ; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29768731; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29768731; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/coa.13142; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/coa.13142; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29768731/","systematic review; children; cochlear implantation; comorbidities; congenital cytomegalovirus; performance; prelingual deafness; sensorineural hearing loss","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specific factors, such as determinants of cannabis use or the genetic profile of cannabis users, appear to moderate this association. The present systematic review presents a detailed and up-to-date literature overview on factors that influence the relationship between cannabis use and psychosis risk. A systematic search was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines in MEDLINE and Embase, and 56 studies were included. The results show that, in particular, frequent cannabis use, especially daily use, and the consumption of high-potency cannabis are associated with a higher risk of developing psychosis. Moreover, several genotypes moderate the impact of cannabis use on psychosis risk, particularly those involved in the dopamine function, such as AKT1. Finally, cannabis use is associated with an earlier psychosis onset and increased risk of transition in individuals at a clinical high risk of psychosis. These findings indicate that changing cannabis use behavior could be a harm reduction strategy employed to lower the risk of developing psychosis. Future research should aim to further develop specific biomarkers and genetic profiles for psychosis, thereby contributing to the identification of individuals at the highest risk of developing a psychotic disorder.","2020-02-12","2021-12-15 07:13:02","2021-12-15 07:13:02","","97","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","; ; ; ; ","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32059350/; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7071602; https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/10/2/97/htm; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7071602; https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/10/2/97/pdf","age of onset; cannabis use; clinical high risk; genetics; psychotic disorder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MEDLINE was systematically searched for appropriate studies. Included studies were methodologically appraised. Results of individual studies were meta-analyzed, if possible. Eleven studies, comprising a total of 745 refractory/relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma patients who underwent FDG-PET before autologous SCT, were included. The overall methodological quality of these studies was moderate. The proportion of pretransplant FDG-PET positive patients ranged between 25 and 65.2 %. Progression-free survival ranged between 0 and 52 % in pretransplant FDG-PET positive patients, and between 55 and 85 % in pretransplant FDG-PET negative patients. Overall survival ranged between 17 and 77 % in pretransplant FDG-PET positive patients, and between 78 and 100 % in FDG-PET negative patients. Based on five studies that provided sufficient data for meta-analysis, pooled sensitivity and specificity of pretransplant FDG-PET in predicting treatment failure (i.e., either progressive, residual, or relapsed disease) were 67.2 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 58.2–75.3 %) and 70.7 % (95 % CI 64.2–76.5 %), respectively. Based on two studies that provided sufficient data for meta-analysis, pooled sensitivity and specificity of pretransplant FDG-PET in predicting death during follow-up were 74.4 % (95 % CI 58.8–86.5 %) and 58.0 % (95 % CI 49.3–66.3 %), respectively. In conclusion, the moderate quality evidence suggests pretransplant FDG-PET to have value in predicting outcome in refractory/relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma patients treated with autologous SCT. Nevertheless, a considerable proportion of pretransplant FDG-PET positive patients remains disease free and a considerable proportion of pretransplant FDG-PET negative patients develops disease relapse after autologous SCT.","2016-03-02","2021-12-15 07:13:02","2021-12-15 07:13:02","","695-706","","5","95","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Germany Publisher: Springer Verlag","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/342747; https://core.ac.uk/display/81087861; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F342747; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26931115; https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00277-016-2619-9; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26931115; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00277-016-2619-9.pdf; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26931115/; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00277-016-2619-9; http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26931115","FDG-PET; Systematic review; Autologous stem cell transplantation; Hodgkin lymphoma; Meta-analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to summarize cardiovascular medication use between 1995–2015 and to assess factors in associated with the trends in cardiovascular medications. Method A systematic search was conducted in four databases (Pubmed, Embase, CENTRAL, and CNKI) to obtain observational studies published between 1995 and 2015, reporting on the use of cardiovascular medications in China. Risk of bias of individual studies was appraised and selected studies were pooled for estimated prevalence of cardiovascular medication. Prevalence of cardiovascular medication use for 1995 and 2015 was estimated by random effects meta-regression model. Results From 13,940 identified publications, 35 studies, comprising 28,000 patients, were included. The pooled prevalence for aspirin, beta-blockers, statins, ACE-Inhibitors, ACE-Inhibitor/ARBs and nitrates was 92% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89–0.95], 63% (95% CI: 0.57–0.69), 72% (95% CI: 0.60–0.82), 49% (95% CI: 0.41–0.57), 59% (95% CI: 0.48–0.69) and 79% (95% CI: 0.74–0.91), respectively. A significant increase in beta-blocker and statin use and a decrease of nitrate use was observed over time. The estimated prevalence of beta-blockers, statins, and nitrates was 78%, 91.1%, and 59.3% in 2015, compared to 32%, 17% and 96% in 1995, respectively. Conclusion Cardiovascular medication use after MI is far from optimal in Chinese patients, even though the prevalence of use increased over the period 1995–2015.

However, this reduction simultaneously raised concerns about the long-term outcomes of survivors of early childhood insults. This systematic review focuses on the long-term neurocognitive and mental health outcomes of neonatal insults (NNI) survivors who are six years or older. Methods Two independent reviewers conducted a comprehensive search for empirical literature by combining index and free terms from the inception of the databases until 10th October 2019. We also searched for additional relevant literature from grey literature and using reference tracking. Studies were included if they: were empirical studies conducted in humans; the study participants were followed at six years of age or longer; have an explicit diagnosis of NNI, and explicitly define the outcome and impairment. Medians and interquartile range (IQR) of the proportions of survivors of the different NNI with any impairment were calculated. A random-effect model was used to explore the estimates accounted for by each impairment domain. Results Fifty-two studies with 94,978 participants who survived NNI were included in this systematic review. The overall prevalence of impairment in the survivors of NNI was 10.0% (95% CI 9.8–10.2). The highest prevalence of impairment was accounted for by congenital rubella (38.8%: 95% CI 18.8–60.9), congenital cytomegalovirus (23.6%: 95% CI 9.5–41.5), and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (23.3%: 95% CI 14.7–33.1) while neonatal jaundice has the lowest proportion (8.6%: 95% CI 2.7–17.3). The most affected domain was the neurodevelopmental domain (16.6%: 95% CI 13.6–19.8). The frequency of impairment was highest for neurodevelopmental impairment [22.0% (IQR = 9.2–24.8)] and least for school problems [0.0% (IQR = 0.0–0.00)] in any of the conditions. Conclusion The long-term impact of NNI is also experienced in survivors of NNI who are 6 years or older, with impairments mostly experienced in the neurodevelopmental domain. However, there are limited studies on long-term outcomes of NNI in sub-Saharan Africa despite the high burden of NNI in the region.

Recent consensus has defined hangover as 'mental and physical symptoms, experienced the day after a single episode of heavy drinking, starting when blood alcohol concentration (BAC) approaches zero'. In light of this, we aimed to review the literature systematically to evaluate and estimate mean effect sizes of the next-day effects of heavy alcohol consumption on cognition. METHODS Embase, PubMed and PsycNET databases were searched between December 2016 and May 2018 using terms based on 'alcohol' and 'hangover'. Studies of experimental designs which reported the next-day cognitive effects of heavy alcohol consumption in a 'hangover' group with BAC < 0.02% were reviewed. A total of 805 articles were identified. Thirty-nine full-text articles were screened by two independent reviewers and 19 included in the systematic review; 11 articles provided sufficient data to be included in the meta-analysis; 1163 participants across 19 studies conducted since 1970 were included in the analysis. Data for study design, hangover severity, BAC at testing and cognitive performance were extracted and effect estimates calculated. RESULTS The systematic review suggested that sustained attention and driving abilities were impaired during hangover. Mixed results were observed for: psychomotor skills, short- (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) and divided attention. The meta-analysis revealed evidence of impairments in STM [g = 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.15-1.13], LTM (Hedges' g = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.01-1.17) sustained attention (g = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.07-0.87) and psychomotor speed (Hedges' g = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.31-1.00) during alcohol hangover. CONCLUSION The research literature suggests that alcohol hangovers may involve impaired cognitive functions and performance of everyday tasks such as driving.","2018-08-30","2021-12-15 07:13:03","2021-12-15 07:13:03","","2182-2193","","12","113","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/add.14404; https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/publications/a-systematic-review-of-the-nextday-effects-of-heavy-alcohol-consumption-on-cognitive-performance(c60e3742-e8d5-4087-a586-c9788ad31b79).html; https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-systematic-review-of-the-next-day-effects-of-heavy-alcohol-cons; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.14404; https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/168632323/Gunn_et_al_2018_Addiction.pdf; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30144191; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30144191/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6282576; https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/a-systematic-review-of-the-next-day-effects-of-heavy-alcohol-cons; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30144191; https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/a-systematic-review-of-the-nextday-effects-of-heavy-alcohol-consumption-on-cognitive-performance(c60e3742-e8d5-4087-a586-c9788ad31b79).html; https://core.ac.uk/download/161257769.pdf","Alcohol; cognition; driving; hangover; memory; psychomotor; sustained attention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper reviews the evidence on sonication fluid and tissue sampling for the diagnosis of FRI. Methods: A comprehensive search in Pubmed, Embase and Web-of-Science was carried out on April 5, 2018, to identify diagnostic validation studies regarding sonication fluid and tissue sampling for FRI. Results: Out of 2624 studies, nine fulfilled the predefined inclusion criteria. Five studies focused on sonication fluid culture, two on PCR and two on histopathology. One additional histopathology study was found after screening of reference lists. There is limited evidence that sonication fluid culture may be a useful adjunct to conventional tissue culture, but no strong evidence that it is superior or can replace tissue culture. Regarding molecular techniques and histopathology the evidence is even less clear. Overall, studies had variable 'gold standard' criteria for comparison and poorly reported culture methods. Conclusions: Scientific evidence on sonication fluid and tissue sampling, including culture, molecular techniques and histopathology for the diagnosis of FRI is scarce. It is imperative that laboratory protocols become standardized and uniform diagnostic criteria, as recently published in a consensus definition, be implemented.","2018-08-10","2021-12-15 07:13:03","2021-12-15 07:13:03","","173-181","","4","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Germany Publisher: Copernicus GmbH","","; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://jbji.copernicus.org/articles/3/173/2018/jbji-3-173-2018.pdf; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30155402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6098816; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30155402/; https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/575505; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6098816; https://jbji.copernicus.org/articles/3/173/2018/","systematic review; diagnosis; Fracture-related infection; histopathology; sonication; tissue sampling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Childhood ITP has different disease characteristics, and the diagnostic and prognostic value of anti-platelet antibody testing remains uncertain. Objective To systematically review the diagnostic accuracy of anti-platelet autoantibody testing in childhood ITP. Methods PubMed and EMBASE were searched for studies evaluating immunoassays in childhood ITP. Study quality was assessed (QUADAS2), and evidence was synthesized descriptively. Results In total, 40 studies (1606 patients) were identified. Nine studies reported sufficient data to determine diagnostic accuracy measures. Anti-platelet IgG antibody testing showed a moderate sensitivity (0·36-0·80 platelet-associated IgG [direct test]; 0·19-0·39 circulating IgG [indirect test]). In studies that reported control data, including patients with non-immune thrombocytopenia, specificity was very good (0·80-1·00). Glycoprotein-specific immunoassays showed comparable sensitivity (three studies) and predominantly identified IgG anti-GP IIb/IIIa antibodies, with few IgG anti-GP Ib/IX antibodies. Anti-platelet IgM antibodies were identified in a substantial proportion of children (sensitivity 0·62-0·64 for direct and indirect tests). Conclusion The diagnostic evaluation of IgG and IgM anti-platelet antibodies may be useful as a rule-in test for ITP.

Breakthrough therapies reduce the bleeding frequency tremendously, but well-defined joint outcome assessments with a focus on early changes and subclinical damage are lacking. Biomarkers reflecting joint tissue turnover/inflammation might be useful to predict invalidating arthropathy. This systematic review summarized and categorized publications on blood/urinary biomarkers in HA to provide leads for implementation. A PubMed/EMBASE search was performed on September 9, 2019. All publications were assessed and allocated to one or several BIPED-categories, based on the utility of biomarkers. Of the initial 1307 publications found, 27 were eligible for inclusion. The majority (81%, n = 32/42) was cross-sectional in design, including relatively small numbers of patients (median 44, interquartile range 35–78). Fourteen percent (n = 6/42) investigated dynamic changes around a bleeding or treatment. Only two studies investigated the prognostic value of biomarkers. Most promising biomarkers were serum Coll2-1, COL-18N, COMP, C1,2C, C2M, CS846, MIF, plasma sVCAM-1 and urinary CTX-II. Comparing performances and pooling data was not possible due to heterogeneity.

This paper describes a systematic review of methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis, comparing trial design between 147 animal and 512 human studies. Animal studies generally included fewer subjects than human studies, and less frequently reported randomisation and blinding. In relation to life span, study duration was comparable for animals and humans, but included animals were younger than included humans. Animal studies often comprised males only (61%), human studies always included females (98% included both sexes). Power calculations were poorly reported in both samples. Analyses of human studies more frequently comprised Chi-square tests, those of animal studies more frequently reported analyses of variance. Administration route was more variable, and more frequently reported in animal than human studies. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein were analysed more frequently in human than in animal studies. To conclude, experimental designs for animal and human studies are not optimally aligned. However, methotrexate is effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis in animal models and humans. Further evaluation of the available evidence in other research fields is needed to increase the understanding of translational success before we can optimise translational strategies.","2020-06-17","2021-12-15 07:13:03","2021-12-15 07:13:03","","1047","","6","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","; ; ; ; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7341304; https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/220843; https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/6/1047; https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/6/1047/pdf; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepository.ubn.ru.nl%3A2066%2F220843","Systematic review; animal-to-human translation; experimental design; methotrexate; rheumatoid arthritis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These involve the use of information about the prognosis of a patient, to make individualized treatment decisions. This has led to an accumulating amount of literature available on prognosis studies. To summarize and evaluate this information overload, high-quality systematic reviews are essential, additionally helping us to facilitate interpretation and usability of prognosis study findings and to identify gaps in literature. Four types of prognosis studies can be identified: overall prognosis, prognostic factors, prognostic models, and predictors of treatment effect. Methodologists have focussed on developing methods and tools for every step of a systematic review for reviews of all four types of prognosis studies, from formulating the review question and writing a protocol to searching for studies, assessing risk of bias, meta-analysing results, and interpretation of results. The growing attention for prognosis research has led to the introduction of the Cochrane Prognosis Methods Group (PMG). Since 2016, reviews of prognosis studies are formally implemented within Cochrane. With these recent methodological developments and tools, and the implementation within Cochrane, it becomes increasingly feasible to perform high-quality reviews of prognosis studies that will have an impact on clinical practice.","2019-01-23","2021-12-15 07:13:03","2021-12-15 07:13:03","","1-4","","1","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: England Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC","","; ; ; ; ","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41512-019-0049-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6460843/; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6460843/; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s41512-019-0049-6.pdf; https://diagnprognres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41512-019-0049-6","Systematic review; Meta-analysis; Prediction; Prognosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: We conducted a systematic search in PubMed Medline, EMBASE and PsycInfo combining the terms and synonyms of ""Tinnitus"" and ""Mindfulness."" The most recent search was performed on December 4th 2018. We wrote this systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Two independent authors identified studies, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. Studies were considered eligible if they included adults with tinnitus, performed a protocolled MBI and measured tinnitus distress with validated questionnaires. Studies were appraised with either the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool or the MINORS criteria, depending on their design. Results: The systematic search yielded seven articles (425 patients). Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), three cohort studies and one comparative controlled trial. Different types of MBIs, including MBCT and MBSR, were assessed with various questionnaires. Two of three RCTs showed a statistically significant decrease in tinnitus distress scores directly after treatment in the mindfulness group compared to the control group. Six of seven studies showed statistically significant decrease in tinnitus distress scores directly after mindfulness therapy. One of three RCTs showed a statistically significant improvement of depression questionnaire scores after MBI compared to the control group directly post treatment. Conclusions: A decrease of tinnitus distress scores in MBIs can be observed directly post-therapy based on moderate to high quality studies. This was found regardless of the heterogeneity of patients, study design, type of MBI and outcome assessment. Two out of three RCTs found clinically relevant decreases in tinnitus distress scores. No effect of MBIs was observed for depression and anxiety in tinnitus patients. Long term effects remain uncertain. Mindfulness may have a place in tinnitus therapy, although the long term effects need to be studied.","2019-11-01","2021-12-15 07:13:03","2021-12-15 07:13:03","","1135-1135","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A.","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31736854/; https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2019.01135/full; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31736854; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31736854; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.amc.nl%3Apublications%2F3e972117-fd3d-4652-8430-3f51a9976fb1; https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fneur.2019.01135/full; http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/391621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6838968/","anxiety; cognitive behavioral therapy; depression; MBCT; MBSR; mindfulness; tinnitus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adverse effects of antipsychotics, including weight gain, may contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS), which is associated with increased risks of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of clinical, biochemical and genetic factors associated with MetS among patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders using second-generation antipsychotics (SGA). Methods: A literature search was performed in Pubmed and Embase to identify all cohort studies, cross-sectional studies and clinical trials investigating associations with MetS in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders using SGAs. We extracted and enumerated clinical, biochemical and genetic factors reported to be associated with MetS. We defined factors associated with MetS as factors being reported as associated with MetS in two or more studies. Results: 58 studies were included in this review (n = 12,123). In total, 62 factors were found to be associated with increased risk of MetS. Thirty one out of 58 studies investigated factors that were reported as associated with MetS in two or more studies. With regard to clinical factors, we found gender, higher age, concomitant use of mood stabilizers, higher baseline and current BMI, earlier SGA exposure, higher dose, longer duration of treatment, psychosis and tobacco smoking to be significantly associated with MetS. Furthermore, the biochemical factors hypo-adiponectinemia, elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and higher white blood cell (WBC) count were identified as factors associated with MetS. Among pharmacogenetic factors, the rs1414334 C-allele of the HTR2C-gene was associated with MetS in patients using SGA. Conclusion: In this systematic review investigating clinical, biochemical and genetic factors associated with MetS in patients using SGAs we found that higher age, higher baseline BMI, higher current BMI and male as well as female gender were positively associated with MetS across all antipsychotics. This study may set the stage for the application of clinical, biochemical and genetic factors to predict the risk of developing MetS in patients using SGAs. Future research is needed to determine which patients using SGAs are at risk to develop MetS in clinical practice.","2021-03-29","2021-12-15 07:13:04","2021-12-15 07:13:04","","625935-625935","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A.","","; ; ; ","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33868046/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8044798; https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC8044798; https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.625935/full","systematic review; antipsychotics; metabolic syndrome; psychotic spectrum disorder; schizophrenia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the impact of PDR on treatment outcomes among people initiating nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART, including the combination of efavirenz (EFV), tenofovir (TDF), and lamivudine or emtricitabine (XTC). Methods We systematically reviewed studies and conference proceedings comparing treatment outcomes in populations initiating NNRTI-based ART with and without PDR. We conducted subgroup analyses by regimen: (1) NNRTIs + 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), (2) EFV + 2 NRTIs, or (3) EFV/TDF/XTC; by population (children vs adults); and by definition of resistance (PDR vs NNRTI PDR). Results Among 6197 studies screened, 32 were analyzed (31 441 patients). We found that individuals with PDR initiating NNRTIs across all the subgroups had increased risk of virological failure compared to those without PDR. Risk of acquisition of new resistance mutations and ART switch was also higher in people with PDR.

The two leprosy bacilli cause similar pathologic conditions. They primarily target the skin and the peripheral nervous system. Currently it is considered a Neglected Tropical Disease, being endemic in specific locations within countries of the Americas, Asia, and Africa, while in Europe it is only rarely reported. The reason for a spatial inequality in the prevalence of leprosy in so-called endemic pockets within a country is still largely unexplained. A systematic review was conducted targeting leprosy transmission research data, using PubMed and Scopus as sources. Publications between January 1, 1945 and July 1, 2019 were included. The transmission pathways of M. leprae are not fully understood. Solid evidence exists of an increased risk for individuals living in close contact with leprosy patients, most likely through infectious aerosols, created by coughing and sneezing, but possibly also through direct contact. However, this systematic review underscores that human-to-human transmission is not the only way leprosy can be acquired. The transmission of this disease is probably much more complicated than was thought before. In the Americas, the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) has been established as another natural host and reservoir of M. leprae. Anthroponotic and zoonotic transmission have both been proposed as modes of contracting the disease, based on data showing identical M. leprae strains shared between humans and armadillos. More recently, in red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) with leprosy-like lesions in the British Isles M. leprae and M. lepromatosis DNA was detected. This finding was unexpected, because leprosy is considered a disease of humans (with the exception of the armadillo), and because it was thought that leprosy (and M. leprae) had disappeared from the United Kingdom. Furthermore, animals can be affected by other leprosy-like diseases, caused by pathogens phylogenetically closely related to M. leprae. These mycobacteria have been proposed to be grouped as a M. leprae-complex. We argue that insights from the transmission and reservoirs of members of the M. leprae-complex might be relevant for leprosy research. A better understanding of possible animal or environmental reservoirs is needed, because transmission from such reservoirs may partly explain the steady global incidence of leprosy despite effective and widespread multidrug therapy. A reduction in transmission cannot be expected to be accomplished by actions or interventions from the human healthcare domain alone, as the mechanisms involved are complex. Therefore, to increase our understanding of the intricate picture of leprosy transmission, we propose a One Health transdisciplinary research approach.","2020-04-27","2021-12-15 07:13:04","2021-12-15 07:13:04","","e0008276","","4","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: Public Library of Science","","; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008276; https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0008276; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32339201/; https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0008276&type=printable; https://www.scilit.net/article/18a9d24ce077bd70ec7f967691b0147b; http://europepmc.org/article/MED/32339201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7205316","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods A systematic review was conducted using PubMed and Embase searches for SLE or SLE-related antibodies and physical, neurocognitive, psychiatric or motor development outcomes in children. Results In total 24 cohort and 4 case-control studies were included after initial screening of 1853 hits. Learning disorders (LD) were reported in 21.4–26% of SLE offspring, exceeding the prevalence in the general population. Four studies reported that dyslexia and reading problems were present in 14.3–21.6% of lupus offspring with a clear male predominance. Furthermore, a twofold increased rate of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (n = 1 study) and a two- to threefold increased risk for speech disorders (n = 3 studies) were reported in lupus offspring compared to controls, although the latter was not statistically significant. More divergent results were found for attention deficit (n = 5 studies) and behavior disorders (n = 3 studies). In two large controlled studies attention disorders were more prevalent and a trend towards more behavior disorders was reported in 2 of 3 studies analyzing this subject. Finally, IQ and motor skills were not affected in respectively 7 and 5 studies. Cardiopulmonary functioning and mood disorders were scarcely investigated (both n = 1). Maternal anti-SSA antibodies were associated with LD in offspring in one study. Other SLE-related antibodies were rarely studied. Conclusion This systematic review suggests that maternal SLE is associated with LD (specifically dyslexia), ASD, attention deficit and probably speech problems in offspring. However, over half of the studies were assigned a low or moderate evidence level. Therefore, further research is necessary to substantiate the found evidence and expand the scope to lesser researched areas such as cardiopulmonary functioning.","2017-05-04","2021-12-15 07:13:04","2021-12-15 07:13:04","","701-711","","7","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands Publisher: Elsevier","","; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28479488/; https://core.ac.uk/display/153349121; http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/358413; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568997217301258; http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28479488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28479488; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568997217301258","Antibodies; Development; Offspring; Pregnancy; Systemic lupus erythematosus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this systematic review we will, therefore, discuss the recent (>2009) literature on the association between neighbourhood deprivation and young people's (0–19 years old) mental health and well-being. We focus on whether neighbourhood deprivation effects exist, and how and for whom the neighbourhood matters. Together, the thirty studies included in the review indicate that overall there are neighbourhood effects on young people's mental health and well-being. The comparison of results from these studies suggests that such associations were more commonly found for well-being and externalising problem behaviour rather than internalising problem behaviour. Also, mental health and well-being seemed to be more often associated with the neighbourhood social environment than neighbourhood socio-economic status and neighbourhood disorder. Studies investigating mediating processes between the linkage between neighbourhood deprivation and mental health and well-being were rare although there was some evidence that processes within the family and peer context are important mechanisms in this linkage. Inconsistent evidence was found regarding the moderating role of age, gender, and ethnicity. There are ongoing challenges of researching the how and for whom neighbourhoods are important. We should work towards rigorous theory and evidence on how different features of residential contexts matter and on differential exposure and vulnerability to these contexts.","2020-11-24","2021-12-15 07:13:04","2021-12-15 07:13:04","","113542","","","270","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Elsevier Limited","","; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33495056; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953620307619","Systematic review; Mental health and well-being; Neighbourhood deprivation effects; Young people","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With increasing maternal age and a higher prevalence of cardiac risk factors, the incidence of IHD during pregnancy is rising. However, information in the literature is scarce. We therefore performed a retrospective cohort study and systematically reviewed the overall (1975-2013) and contemporary (2005-2013) literature concerning IHD presenting during pregnancy or in the post-partum period. We report two cases of IHD with atypical presentation during pregnancy or post-partum. In our review, we describe 146 pregnancies, including 57 contemporary cases (2005-2013). Risk factors for IHD were present in 80 %. Of the cases of IHD, 71 % manifested in the third trimester or the post-partum period, and 95 % presented with chest pain. The main cause was coronary dissection (35 %), or thrombus/emboli (35 %) in the more contemporary group. Maternal mortality was 8 % (6 % in the contemporary group), and the main cardiac complication was ventricular tachycardia (n = 17). Premature delivery rate was 56 %, and caesarean section was performed in 57 %. Perinatal mortality was 4 %.

Methods and Material: To assess volume and study type of clinical research in Otolaryngology we performed a literature search in high impact factor journals. We included 10 high impact factor Otolaryngology journals and 20 high impact factor medical journals outside this field (2011). We extracted original publications and systematic reviews from 2010. Publications were classified according to their research question, that is therapy, diagnosis, prognosis or etiology. Results: From Otolaryngology journals (impact factor 1.8 to 2.8) we identified 694 (46%) publications on original observations and 27 (2%) systematic reviews. From selected medical journals (impact factor 6.0 to 101.8) 122 (2%) publications related to Otolaryngology, 102 (83%) were on original observations and 2 (0.04%) systematic reviews. The most common category was therapy (40%). Conclusion: Half of publications in Otolaryngology concerns clinical research, which is higher than other specialties. In medical journals outside the field of Otolaryngology, a small proportion (2%) of publications is related to Otolaryngology. Striking is that systematic reviews, which are considered high level evidence, make up for only 2% of publications. We must ensure an increase of clinical research for optimizing medical practice.","2019-04-09","2021-12-15 07:13:04","2021-12-15 07:13:04","","18","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: Frontiers Media SA","","; ; ; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31024926; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31024926/; https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fsurg.2019.00018/full; https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsurg.2019.00018/full","diagnosis; etiology; evidence-based medicine; evidence-based practice; impact factor; otolaryngology; prognosis; therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Timely diagnosis and urgent preventive treatment substantially reduce this risk. We conducted a systemic review to quantify patient delay in patients with (suspected) TIA, and assess determinants related to such delay. A systematic review using MEDLINE and EMBASE databases up to March 2017 to identify studies reporting the time from onset of TIA symptoms to seeking medical help. We identified nine studies providing data on patient delay, published between 2006 and 2016, with 7/9 studies originating from the United Kingdom (UK). In total 1103 time-defined TIA patients (no remaining symptoms > 24 h), and 896 patients with a minor stroke (i.e., mild remaining symptoms > 24 h) were included (49.1% men, mean age 72.2 years). Patient’s delay of more than 24 h was reported in 33.1–44.4% of TIA patients, with comparable proportions for minor stroke patients. Delays were on average shorter in patients interviewed at the emergency department than among patients seen at TIA outpatient clinics. Univariably associated with a shorter delay were (1) a longer duration of symptoms, (2) motor symptoms, (3) a higher ABCD2 score, and (4) correct patient’s recognition as possible ischemic cerebrovascular event. More than a third of patients experiencing a TIA delays medical attention for more than a day, thus critically extending the initiation of stroke preventive treatment. There still seems to be insufficient awareness among lay people that symptoms suggestive of TIA should be considered as an emergency. Additional data and multivariable analyses are needed to define main determinants of patient delay.","2018-07-19","2021-12-15 07:13:05","2021-12-15 07:13:05","","1051-1058","","5","266","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Germany Publisher: D.

For each inhibitor, a unique immunohistochemical assay was developed. This systematic review gives an up-to-date insight into the comparability of standardised immunohistochemical assays and laboratory-developed tests (LDTs), focusing specifically on tumour cell (TC) staining and scoring. A systematic search was performed identifying publications that assessed interassay, interobserver and/or interlaboratory concordance of PD-L1 assays and LDTs in tissue of NSCLC patients. Of 4294 publications identified through the systematic search, 27 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were of sufficient methodological quality. Studies assessing interassay concordance found high agreement between assays 22C3, 28-8 and SP263 and properly validated LDTs, and lower concordance for comparisons involving SP142. A decrease in concordance, however, is seen with use of cut-offs, which hampers interchangeability of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays and LDTs. Studies assessing interobserver concordance found high agreement for all assays and LDTs, but lower agreement with use of a 1% cut-off. This may be problematic in clinical practice, as discordance between pathologists at this cut-off may result in some patients being denied valuable treatment options. Finally, five studies assessed interlaboratory concordance and found moderate to high agreement levels for various assays and LDTs. However, to assess the actual existence of interlaboratory variation in PD-L1 testing and PD-L1 positivity in clinical practice, studies using real-world clinical pathology data are needed.","2020-03-24","2021-12-15 07:13:05","2021-12-15 07:13:05","","793-802","","6","76","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell","","; ; ; ; ; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31793055; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/his.14040; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/his.14040; https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7318295; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31793055/; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7318295","systematic review; immunohistochemistry; immunotherapy; non-small-cell lung cancer; predictive biomarker; programmed cell death-ligand 1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A review of systematic reviews of randomized trials reporting on effectiveness of computer-based alcohol interventions published between 2005 and 2015. Fourteen reviews met the inclusion criteria. Across the included reviews, it was generally reported that computer-based alcohol interventions were effective in reducing alcohol consumption, with mostly small effect sizes. There were indications that longer, multisession interventions are more effective than shorter or single session interventions. Evidence on the association between therapeutic orientation of an intervention, guidance or trial engagement and reductions in alcohol consumption is limited, as the number of reviews addressing these themes is low. None of the included reviews addressed the association between therapeutic orientation, length of intervention or guidance and trial engagement. This review of systematic reviews highlights the mostly positive evidence supporting computer-based alcohol interventions as well as reveals a number of knowledge gaps that could guide future research in this field.","2016-10-18","2021-12-15 07:13:05","2021-12-15 07:13:05","","646-658","","5","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: Routledge","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/66724/; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12529-016-9601-8; https://core.ac.uk/display/77064950; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27757844/; https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/publications/computer-based-interventions-for-problematic-alcohol-use-a-review; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.amc.nl%3Apublications%2F8dd3d366-3541-486a-8f40-0c10bb926956; https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27757844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5608865; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5608865; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs12529-016-9601-8.pdf; https://core.ac.uk/download/154425551.pdf","Systematic review; Meta-analysis; Alcohol; Computer-based intervention; E-health; Internet intervention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

LVDD/HFpEF models were divided based on underlying pathology: hemodynamic overload (17 comparisons), metabolic alteration (16 comparisons) or ageing (3 comparisons). Meta-analysis showed that echocardiographic parameters were not consistently altered in LVDD/HFpEF with invasive hemodynamic measurements better representing LVDD. Increased myocardial fibrotic area indicated comparable characteristics between hemodynamic and metabolic models. Regarding MMPs and TIMPs; MMP2 and MMP9 activity and protein and TIMP1 protein levels were mainly enhanced in hemodynamic models. In most cases only mRNA was assessed and there were no correlations between cardiac tissue and plasma levels. Female gender, a known risk factor for LVDD and HFpEF, was underrepresented.

The problem affects the ability to verify the accuracy of any analysis, to repeat methods used, and to assimilate the study findings into powerful and useful meta-analyses. The problem is common in a variety of ecological topics examined to date, and despite previous calls for improved reporting and metadata archiving, which could indirectly alleviate the problem, there is no indication of an improvement in reporting standards over time.

Numerous studies on the correlates of both prenatal and postnatal mother-to-infant bonding quality have been published over the last decades. An up-to-date systematic review of these correlates is lacking, however. Objective To systematically review correlates of prenatal and postnatal mother-to-infant bonding quality in the general population, in order to enable targeted interventions. Methods MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsychINFO were searched through May 2018. Reference checks were performed. Case-control, cross-sectional or longitudinal cohort studies written in English, German, Swedish, Spanish, Norwegian, French or Dutch defining mother-to-infant bonding quality as stipulated in the protocol (PROSPERO CRD42016040183) were included. Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts, full-text articles and extracted data. Methodological quality was assessed using the National Institute of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-sectional studies and was rated accordingly as poor, fair or good. Clinical and methodological heterogeneity were examined. Main results 131 studies were included. Quality was fair for 20 studies, and poor for 111 studies. Among 123 correlates identified, 3 were consistently associated with mother-to-infant bonding quality: 1) duration of gestation at assessment was positively associated with prenatal bonding quality, 2) depressive symptoms were negatively associated with postnatal mother-to-infant bonding quality, and 3) mother-to-infant bonding quality earlier in pregnancy or postpartum was positively associated with mother-to-infant bonding quality later in time. Conclusion Our review suggests that professionals involved in maternal health care should consider monitoring mother-to-infant bonding already during pregnancy.

We set out to define the most important characteristics that define the degree of cardiac remodeling in this model. A systematic review and meta-analyses were performed on studies using the TAC mouse/rat model and reporting echocardiographic outcome parameters. We included all animal studies in which a constriction around the transverse aorta and at least one of the predefined echocardiography or MRI outcome parameters were assessed. A total of 502 articles and > 3000 wild-type, untreated animals undergoing TAC were included in this study and referenced to a control group. The duration of aortic constriction correlated to the degree of adverse remodeling. However, the mouse data is strongly biased by the preferential use of male C57Bl/6 mice (66% of studies). Furthermore, mostly ketamine/xylazine anesthetics, 27G needle constriction, and silk sutures are used. Nonetheless, despite the homogeneity in experimental design, the model contained a substantial degree of heterogeneity in the functional outcome measures. When looking at study quality, only 12% reported randomization, 23% mentioned any sort of blinding, 25% adequately addressed the outcomes, and an amazingly low percentage (2%) showed sample size calculation. Meta-analyses did not detect specific study characteristics that explained the heterogeneity in the reported outcome measures, however this might be related to the strong bias towards the use of specific mouse lines, sex as well as age or to poor reporting of characteristics of study quality.","2020-04-25","2021-12-15 07:13:05","2021-12-15 07:13:05","","1515-1524","","6","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands Publisher: Springer Netherlands","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://repub.eur.nl/pub/126699/Repub_126699_O-A.pdf; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32335789/; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10741-020-09960-w; https://repub.eur.nl/pub/126699; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10741-020-09960-w.pdf; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepub.eur.nl%3A126699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32335789; https://core.ac.uk/download/322667963.pdf","Systematic review; Meta-analysis; Animal model; Hear failure; Transverse aortic constriction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this systematic review was to explore whether there is evidence supporting this proposition, and to explore how cue-reminders are applied in health-risk behavior interventions to date. Method: We systemically reviewed (non-) randomized trials that examine differences in health-risk behaviors between an experimental group receiving an intervention with exposure to a cue-reminder and a control group receiving the intervention without such cue. Results: Six studies were eligible for inclusion. The studies differed in sample and research design, and how the cue-reminder was applied. One study demonstrated a positive and small effect, and one study found a negative medium effect of the cue-reminder. In the remaining studies, the effect sizes were positive but non-significant. Discussion: It is unclear whether complementing health-risk behavior interventions with cue-reminders increases the effectiveness of these interventions. Further investigation and experimentation into the efficiency and effectiveness of cue-reminders is needed before health-risk behavior interventions are complemented with cue-reminders.","2019-04-30","2021-12-15 07:13:05","2021-12-15 07:13:05","","97-97","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: Frontiers Media SA","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6524686/; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31134173/; https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC6524686; http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/390441; https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00097/pdf; https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00097/full; https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/203412; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepository.ubn.ru.nl%3A2066%2F203412","cue-reminder; health promotion; health-risk behaviors; intervention programs; reminder cue","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We performed a systematic review of HRQL studies in adult burn patients to evaluate study design, instruments used, methodological quality, and recovery patterns. Methods A systematic review was performed. Relevant databases were searched from the earliest record until October 2016. Studies examining HRQL in adults after burn injuries were included. Risk of bias was scored using the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool. Results Twenty different HRQL instruments were used among the 94 included studies. The Burn Specific Health Scale–Brief (BSHS-B) (46%), the Short Form–36 (SF-36) (42%) and the EuroQol questionnaire (EQ-5D) (9%) were most often applied. Most domains, both mentally and physically orientated, were affected shortly after burns but improved over time. The lowest scores were reported for the domains ‘work’ and ‘heat sensitivity’ (BSHS-B), ‘bodily pain’, ‘physical role limitations’ (SF-36), and ‘pain/discomfort’ (EQ-5D) in the short-term and for ‘work’ and ‘heat sensitivity’, ‘emotional functioning’ (SF-36), ‘physical functioning’ and ‘pain/discomfort’ in the long-term. Risk of bias was generally low in outcome measurement and high in study attrition. Conclusion Consensus on preferred validated methodologies of HRQL measurement in burn patients would facilitate comparability across studies, resulting in improved insights in recovery patterns and better estimates of HRQL after burns. We recommend to develop a guideline on the measurement of HRQL in burns. Five domains representing a variety of topics had low scores in the long-term and require special attention in the aftermath of burns.","2018-05-24","2021-12-15 07:13:05","2021-12-15 07:13:05","","1-21","","5","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: Public Library of Science","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29795616; https://repub.eur.nl/pub/107150; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.atira.dk%3Apublications%2F4f773b1e-bfaa-4cba-ad6a-462e7d5c0752; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197507&type=printable; https://research.vumc.nl/en/publications/health-related-quality-of-life-in-adults-after-burn-injuries-a-sy; https://doaj.org/article/157308ff5b7a4cf0925dc9d1fef30a8e; https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0197507; https://repub.eur.nl/pub/107150/REPUB_107150-OA.pdf; http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/369836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5967732/; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/29795616; http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PLoSO..1397507S/abstract; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29795616/; https://core.ac.uk/download/158600741.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is important that the decision to return to sport (RTS) is made carefully, based on sharply delimited criteria. Lack of a well-defined definition and criteria hampers the decision to RTS among athletes with AT, and impedes comparison of RTS rates between different studies. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature for definitions of, and criteria for, RTS in AT research. Qualitative systematic review. The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, CINAHL, PEDro, and Scopus electronic databases were searched for articles that reported on the effect of a physiotherapeutic intervention for midportion AT. Article selection was independently performed by two researchers. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the included studies and extract definitions of, and criteria for, RTS. Thirty-five studies were included in the content analysis, showing large variety in both the definitions and criteria. Thirty-two studies reported a definition of RTS, but only 19 studies described the criteria for RTS. The content analysis revealed that ‘reaching pre-injury activity/sports level, with the ability to perform training and matches without limitations’, ‘absence of pain’, and ‘recovery’ were the main content categories used to define RTS. Regarding the criteria for RTS, eight different content categories were defined: (1) ‘level of pain’; (2) ‘level of functional recovery’; (3) ‘recovery of muscle strength’; (4) ‘recovery of range of motion’; (5) ‘level of endurance of the involved limb’; (6) ‘medical advice’; (7) ‘psychosocial factors’; and (8) ‘anatomical/physiological properties of the musculotendinous complex’. Many criteria were not clearly operationalized and lacked specific information. This systematic review shows that RTS may be defined according to the pre-injury level of sports (including both training and matches), but also with terms related to the absence of pain and recovery. Multiple criteria for RTS were found, which were all related to level of pain, level of functional recovery, muscular strength, range of motion, endurance, medical advice, psychosocial factors, or anatomical/physiological properties of the Achilles tendon. For most of the criteria we identified, no clear operationalization was given, which limits their validity and practical usability. Further research on how RTS after midportion AT should be defined, and which criteria should be used, is warranted.

Despite strong medical advice to the contrary, an FOP patient insisted on surgery to alleviate her complete trismus, which caused an unbearable impact on her quality of life (QOL). The entire trismus history of this FOP patient is presented. [18F]-NaF position emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scans were introduced as an imaging method for heterotopic bone formation activity. To place our findings into context, a systematic review on jaw surgery in FOP was performed. After falling down the stairs, a 9-year-old patient developed mobility impairment of her left-sided jaw. During the following 13 years bone scintigraphy showed persistent activity of the disease leading to progressive left-sided zygomatico-mandibular fusion by HO, resulting in complete trismus. Within 1 month after HO removal on the left side and a matching right coronoidectomy, [18F]-NaF PET/CT demonstrated a substantial flare-up activity followed by new HO in both masseter and temporalis muscles. Despite recurrent HO and trismus her QOL increased due to a stable increased interincisal opening of 5.5 mm. Although systematic review reveals a 100% risk of HO recurrence after jaw surgery, information on improved QOL is scarce. In conclusion, surgery in FOP may be beneficial for QOL despite new HO formation. Assessment of disease activity using [18F]-NaF PET/CT is possible before HO is evident on CT and may serve as a new and quantitative marker of the disease. © 2017 The Authors.

This proof-of-concept study uses a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between variants of the serotonin transporter promoter (5-HTTLPR) and autism to explore the hypothesis that some missing heritability can be explained using an optimum curve. A systematic literature search was performed to identify transmission disequilibrium tests on the short/long (S/L) 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in relation to autism. We analysed five American, seven European, four Asian and two American/European samples. We found no transmission preference in the joint samples and in Europe, preferential transmission of S in America and preferential transmission of L in Asia. Heritability will be underestimated or missed in genetic association studies if two alternative genetic variants are associated with the same disorder in different subsets of a sample. An optimum curve, relating a multifactorial biological variable that incorporates genes and environment to a score for a human trait, such as social competence, can explain this. We suggest that variants of functionally related genes will sometimes appear in fixed combinations at both sides of an optimum curve and propose that future association studies should account for such combinations.","2019-10-15","2021-12-15 07:13:06","2021-12-15 07:13:06","","5104","","20","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/20/20/5104/pdf; https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/tackling-missing-heritability-by-use-of-an-optimum-curve-a-system; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Ascholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl%3Aitem_2914931; http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/392000; https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/31618836; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31618836/; https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/20/20/5104/htm; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6829377","systematic review; 5-HTTLPR polymorphism; autism; context-dependent risk variants; genetic association; inverted U; meta-analysis; missing heritability; multifactorial variable; optimum curve","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, measures of postoperative care to promote flap maturity vary greatly. Dangling protocols tend to be highly divergent regarding the start, duration, schedules and monitoring of dangling, as well as the additional use of compression stockings or bandaging. The aim of this systematic review to review and evaluate current literature and to provide recommendations. Methods A systematic literature review was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Literature databases were searched for relevant articles about early ambulation following lower leg reconstruction. Results A total of 10 articles met the inclusion criteria: 2 randomized controlled trials and 7 case-series and one cohort study. The optimal start, duration and frequency of the dangling and compression procedures remain unclear, and so does the necessity of dangling and compression in general. An early and aggressive dangling procedure can be safely introduced on postoperative day (POD) 3, taking possible comorbidities into consideration. Early initiation might help shorten hospital stay, thereby reducing associated medical costs. Furthermore, compressive wrapping applied to the dangled leg seems to have a positive effect on flap perfusion and patient comfort. Conclusion Based on the current literature, it is suggested that an early and aggressive dangling procedure can safely be started on POD 3. Compression therapy during dangling increases perfusion and venous return of the free flap and increases the comfort of the patient.","2020","2021-12-15 07:13:06","2021-12-15 07:13:06","","21-26","","","1-2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666769X20300038","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Where data are collected but remain unpublished, they cannot contribute to this distillation of knowledge. If these unpublished data differ substantially from published work, conclusions may not reflect adequately the underlying biological effects being described. The existence and any impact of such “publication bias” in the laboratory sciences have not been described. Using the CAMARADES (Collaborative Approach to Meta-analysis and Review of Animal Data in Experimental Studies) database we identified 16 systematic reviews of interventions tested in animal studies of acute ischaemic stroke involving 525 unique publications. Only ten publications (2%) reported no significant effects on infarct volume and only six (1.2%) did not report at least one significant finding. Egger regression and trim-and-fill analysis suggested that publication bias was highly prevalent (present in the literature for 16 and ten interventions, respectively) in animal studies modelling stroke. Trim-and-fill analysis suggested that publication bias might account for around one-third of the efficacy reported in systematic reviews, with reported efficacy falling from 31.3% to 23.8% after adjustment for publication bias. We estimate that a further 214 experiments (in addition to the 1,359 identified through rigorous systematic review; non publication rate 14%) have been conducted but not reported. It is probable that publication bias has an important impact in other animal disease models, and more broadly in the life sciences.","2010-03-30","2021-12-15 07:13:06","2021-12-15 07:13:06","","1-8","","3","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: Public Library of Science","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20361022; https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000344; http://www.dcn.ed.ac.uk/camarades//files/PLOS_Biology_PubBias.pdf; https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/en/publications/publication-bias-in-reports-of-animal-stroke-studies-leads-to-major-overstatement-of-efficacy(243d757a-b23e-4b13-82a0-a0a85e2af0c3).html; https://core.ac.uk/display/28969820; https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/8225089/Sena_et_al_2010.pdf; https://ideas.repec.org/a/plo/pbio00/1000344.html; https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/8225089/Sena_et_al_2010.pdf; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20361022/; https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/publication-bias-in-reports-of-animal-stroke-studies-leads-to-maj; https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2846857; https://www.wellbeingintlstudiesrepository.org/valaexp/17; https://www.wellbeingintlstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&context=valaexp; https://animalstudiesrepository.org/valaexp/17/; https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000344; https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/263896; https://core.ac.uk/download/28969820.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) tool for RCTs helps authors to judge the RoB. as ‘‘low”, “high” or “unclear”. Objective In this study we aimed to assess whether the implementation and updates of the CONSORT statement influenced the trend of “unclear” RoB scores of RCTs included in Cochrane systematic reviews. Methods All Cochrane reviews published in December to October 2016 were retrieved. The publication year of RCTS included in the reviews were sorted into time frames (≤1995, 1996–2000, 2001–2009 and ≥2010) based on the release- and updates of the CONSORT statement (1996, 2001 and 2010). The association between “unclear” RoB versus “low or high” RoB and the year of publication in different time frames were calculated using a binary logistic regression. Results Data was extracted from 64 Cochrane reviews, with 989 RCTS (6471 items). The logistic regression showed that the odds of RCTs published ≥2010, compared to ≤1995 were more likely not to report an “unclear” RoB for the total data (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.69 (95% Confidence interval: 0.59–0.80)), random sequence generation (OR 0.32 (0.22–0.47), allocation concealment (0.64 (0.43–0.95)) and incomplete outcome data (OR 0.60 (0.39–0.91)). Conclusion A slight decrease of “unclear” RoB reporting over time was found. To improve quality of reporting authors are encouraged to adhere to reporting guidelines.","2020-07-10","2021-12-15 07:13:06","2021-12-15 07:13:06","","1-9","","7","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: Public Library of Science","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7351499; https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:plo:pone00:0235535; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0235535; https://plos.figshare.com/collections/The_effect_of_the_CONSORT_statement_on_the_amount_of_unclear_Risk_of_Bias_reporting_in_Cochrane_Systematic_Reviews/5056499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7351499; https://figshare.com/collections/The_effect_of_the_CONSORT_statement_on_the_amount_of_unclear_Risk_of_Bias_reporting_in_Cochrane_Systematic_Reviews/5056499; https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PLoSO..1535535R/abstract; https://ideas.repec.org/a/plo/pone00/0235535.html; https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235535; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32650340/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Electroencephalographical intermediate phenotypes (EIP) have the potential to constitute a valuable tool when studying genetic risk loci for schizophrenia, in particular P3b amplitude, P50 suppression, mismatch negativity (MMN) and resting state power spectra of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Here, we systematically reviewed studies investigating the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with these EIPs and meta-analysed them when appropriate. We retrieved 45 studies (N = 34,971 study participants). Four SNPs investigated in more than one study were genome-wide significant for an association with schizophrenia and three were genome-wide suggestive, based on a lookup in the influential 2014 GWAS (Ripke et al., 2014). However, in our meta-analyses, rs1625579 failed to reach a statistically significant association with p3b amplitude decrease and rs4680 risk allele carrier status was not associated with p3b amplitude decrease or with impaired p50 suppression. In conclusion, evidence for SNP associations with EIPs remains limited to individual studies. Careful selection of EIPs and SNPs, combined with consistent reporting of effect sizes, directions of effect and p-values would aid future meta-analyses.","2020-06-07","2021-12-15 07:13:06","2021-12-15 07:13:06","","110001","","","104","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands Publisher: Elsevier Inc.","","; ; ; ; ; ","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278584620303171; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584620303171; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32525059/; http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32525059/; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.amc.nl%3Apublications%2F0502655b-cba4-4b85-8805-c24fd8e56ac0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32525059","Electroencephalography (EEG); Electrophysiology; ERP; Intermediate phenotypes; Schizophrenia; SNP","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A systematic assessment of the methodological quality of the included studies (k = 41) indicated that most studies suffered from methodological limitations (i.e., poor masking procedures, poor awareness measures, researcher degrees of freedom, and trial-order effects), and that higher quality predicted lower odds of studies concluding in favor of contingency unaware fear conditioning. Furthermore, meta-analytic moderation analyses indicated no evidence for a specific set of conditions under which contingency unaware fear conditioning can be observed. Finally, funnel plot asymmetry and p-curve analysis indicated evidence for publication bias.

These discussions have been useful in providing new information, but have resulted in significant confusion regarding the acceptability of CO2 for rodent euthanasia. In some cases, researchers and veterinarians have become uncertain as to which techniques to recommend or use for euthanasia of laboratory mice and rats. Methods: The International Association of Colleges of Laboratory Animal Medicine (IACLAM) convened a taskforce to examine the evidence for adverse welfare indicators in laboratory rats and mice undergoing CO2 euthanasia using a SYRCLE-registered systematic review protocol. Of 3,772 papers identified through a database search (PubMed, Web of Science, CAB Direct, Agricola, and grey literature) from 1900 to 2017, 37 studies were identified for detailed review (some including more than one species or age group), including 15 in adult mice, 21 in adult rats, and 5 in neonates of both species. Experiments or reports were excluded if they only assessed parameters other than those directly affecting animal welfare during CO2 induction and/or euthanasia. Results: Study design and outcome measures were highly variable and there was an unclear to high risk of bias in many of the published studies. Changes in the outcome measures evaluated were inconsistent or poorly differentiated. It is likely that repeated exposures to carbon dioxide inhalation are aversive to adult rats and mice, based on avoidance behavior studies; however, this effect is largely indistinguishable from aversion induced by repeated exposures to other inhalant anesthetic gasses. Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence to permit an unbiased assessment of the effect of CO2 inhalation during euthanasia on welfare indicators in laboratory mice and rats. Additional well-designed, unbiased, and adequately powered studies are needed to accurately assess the welfare of laboratory mice and rats undergoing euthanasia via CO2 gas.","2020-07-22","2021-12-15 07:13:07","2021-12-15 07:13:07","","411","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: Frontiers Media SA","","; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32793645; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7387666; https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.00411/full; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32793645/; https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fvets.2020.00411/full; https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/225409; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepository.ubn.ru.nl%3A2066%2F225409","systematic review; animal welfare; carbon dioxide; distress; euthanasia; mouse; pain; rat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A systematic search was performed in PubMed and Embase in December 2019. Studies that met the following criteria were included: (1) the model was applicable in type 2 diabetes; (2) the outcome was retinopathy; and (3) follow-up was more than 1 year. Screening, data extraction (using the checklist for critical appraisal and data extraction for systemic reviews of prediction modelling studies [CHARMS]) and risk of bias assessment (by prediction model risk of bias assessment tool [PROBAST]) were performed independently by two reviewers. Selected models were externally validated in the large Hoorn Diabetes Care System (DCS) cohort in the Netherlands. Retinopathy risk was calculated using baseline data and compared with retinopathy incidence over 5 years. Calibration after intercept adjustment and discrimination (Harrell’s C statistic) were assessed. Twelve studies were included in the systematic review, reporting on 16 models. Outcomes ranged from referable retinopathy to blindness. Discrimination was reported in seven studies with C statistics ranging from 0.55 (95% CI 0.54, 0.56) to 0.84 (95% CI 0.78, 0.88). Five studies reported on calibration. Eight models could be compared head-to-head in the DCS cohort (N = 10,715). Most of the models underestimated retinopathy risk. Validating the models against different severities of retinopathy, C statistics ranged from 0.51 (95% CI 0.49, 0.53) to 0.89 (95% CI 0.88, 0.91). Several prognostic models can accurately predict retinopathy risk in a population-based type 2 diabetes cohort. Most of the models include easy-to-measure predictors enhancing their applicability. Tailoring retinopathy screening frequency based on accurate risk predictions may increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of diabetic retinopathy care.

It is associated with substantial morbidity and increased healthcare costs. The current systematic review and meta-analysis aim to quantify the incidence of cerebrospinal fluid leakage in the pediatric population and identify its risk factors. The authors followed the PRISMA guidelines. The Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane database were searched for studies reporting CSF leakage after intradural cranial surgery in patients up to 18 years old. Meta-analysis of incidences was performed using a generalized linear mixed model. Twenty-six articles were included in this systematic review. Data were retrieved of 2929 patients who underwent a total of 3034 intradural cranial surgeries. Surprisingly, only four of the included articles reported their definition of CSF leakage. The overall CSF leakage rate was 4.4% (95% CI 2.6 to 7.3%). The odds of CSF leakage were significantly greater for craniectomy as opposed to craniotomy (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.7 to 13.4) and infratentorial as opposed to supratentorial surgery (OR 5.9, 95% CI 1.7 to 20.6). The odds of CSF leakage were significantly lower for duraplasty use versus no duraplasty (OR 0.41 95% CI 0.2 to 0.9). The overall CSF leakage rate after intradural cranial surgery in the pediatric population is 4.4%. Risk factors are craniectomy and infratentorial surgery. Duraplasty use is negatively associated with CSF leak. We suggest defining a CSF leak as “leakage of CSF through the skin,” as an unambiguous definition is fundamental for future research.","2021-02-04","2021-12-15 07:13:07","2021-12-15 07:13:07","","1439-1447","","5","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Germany Publisher: Springer Verlag","","; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/199454/; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33538867/; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00381-021-05036-8.pdf; https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC8084768; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33538867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33538867; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00381-021-05036-8","Cerebrospinal fluid leakage; Craniectomy; Craniotomy; Pediatrics; Posterior fossa surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alternatives with less (severe) adverse effects but with good efficacy are needed. Selective GC receptor modulators (SGRMs) are designed to engage the GC receptor with dissociative characteristics: transactivation of genes, which is mainly responsible for unwanted effects, is less strong while trans-repression of genes, reducing inflammation, is maintained. It is expected that SGRMs thus have a better efficacy/safety balance than GCs. A systematic review providing an overview of the evidence in arthritis is lacking. OBJECTIVE To systematically review the current literature on efficacy and safety of oral SGRMs in comparison to GCs in arthritis. METHODS A search was performed in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library, from inception dates of databases until May 2017. Experimental studies involving animal arthritis models or human material of arthritis patients, as well as clinical studies in arthritis patients were included, provided they reported original data. All types of arthritis were included. Data was extracted on the SGRM studied and on the GC used as reference standard; the design or setting of the study was extracted as well as the efficacy and safety results. RESULTS A total of 207 articles was retrieved of which 17 articles were eligible for our analysis. Two studies concerned randomized controlled trials (RCT), five studies were pre-clinical studies using human material, and 10 studies involved pre-clinical animal models (acute and/or chronic arthritis induced in mice or rats). PF-04171327, the only compound investigated in a clinical trial setting, had a better efficacy/safety balance compared to GCs: better clinical anti-inflammatory efficacy and similar safety. CONCLUSION Studies assessing both efficacy and safety of SGRMs are scarce. There is limited evidence for dissociation of anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects of the SGRMs studied. Development of many SGRMs is haltered in a preclinical phase. One SGRM showed a better clinical efficacy/safety balance.","2017-12-21","2021-12-15 07:13:07","2021-12-15 07:13:07","","e0188810","","12","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: Public Library of Science","","; ; ; ; ","https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0188810; https://core.ac.uk/display/149319261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29267302; http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PLoSO..1288810S/abstract; http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/29267302","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The search strategy included keywords and MeSH or Emtree terms relating blunt chest trauma (including rib fractures), analgesic interventions, pain management and complications. A total of 19 papers met our inclusion criteria and were finally included in this systematic review. Significant differences were found in favor of epidural analgesia for the reduction of pain. No significant differences were observed between epidural analgesia, intravenous analgesia, paravertebral blocks and intercostal blocks, for the secondary outcomes. Results of this study show that epidural analgesia provides better pain relief than the other modalities. No differences were observed for secondary endpoints like length of ICU stay, length of mechanical ventilation or pulmonary complications.

Most relapses occur in the first 2 years after diagnosis. Early response assessment with 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) may facilitate early change of treatment, thereby preventing ineffective treatment and unnecessary side effects. We aimed to assess the predictive value of visually-assessed interim 18F-FDG PET on progression-free survival (PFS) or event-free survival (EFS) in DLBCL patients treated with first-line immuno-chemotherapy regimens. For this systematic review and meta-analysis Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched until July 11, 2017. Prospective and retrospective studies investigating qualitative interim PET response assessment without treatment adaptation based on the interim PET result were eligible. The primary outcome was two-year PFS or EFS. Prognostic and diagnostic measures were extracted and analysed with pooled hazard ratios and Hierarchical Summary Receiver Operator Characteristic Curves, respectively. Meta-regression was used to study covariate effects. The pooled hazard ratio for 18 studies comprising 2,255 patients was 3.13 (95%CI 2.52–3.89) with a 95% prediction interval of 1.68–5.83. In 19 studies with 2,366 patients, the negative predictive value for progression generally exceeded 80% (64–95), but sensitivity (33–87), specificity (49–94), and positive predictive values (20–74) ranged widely. These findings showed that interim 18F-FDG PET has predictive value in DLBCL patients. However, (subgroup) analyses were limited by lack of information and small sample sizes. Some diagnostic test characteristics were not satisfactory, especially the positive predictive value should be improved, before a successful risk stratified treatment approach can be implemented in clinical practice.","2018-08-23","2021-12-15 07:13:07","2021-12-15 07:13:07","","65-79","","1","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Germany Publisher: Springer Verlag","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/1874/378307/1/burggraaff.pdf; http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/378307; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00259-018-4103-3; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F378307; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30141066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30141066; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00259-018-4103-3/fulltext.html; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00259-018-4103-3.pdf; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30141066/; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30141066; https://research.vumc.nl/en/publications/predictive-value-of-interim-positron-emission-tomography-in-diffu","Systematic review; Meta-analysis; Aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma; Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; Positron-emission tomography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this global measure of cardiac function might not be suitable to detect the regional effects sorted by this therapy and is hampered by high operator variability and loading dependency. Deformation imaging might be more accurate in detecting potential regional functional improvements by cardiac regenerative therapy. The aim of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive overview of current literature on the value of deformation imaging in cardiac regenerative therapy. A systematic review of current literature available on PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases was performed regarding both animal and patient studies in which deformation imaging was used to study cardiac cell therapy. After critical appraisal, outcomes regarding study design, type of cell therapy, procedural characteristics, outcome measure, method for measuring strain, and efficacy on both LVEF and deformation parameters were depicted. A total of 30 studies, 15 preclinical and 15 clinical, were included for analysis. Deformation outcomes improved significantly in 14 out of 15 preclinical studies and in 10 out of 15 clinical studies, whereas LVEF improved in 12 and 4 articles, respectively. Study designs and used deformation outcomes varied significantly among the included papers. Six studies found a positive effect on deformation outcomes without LVEF improvement. Hence, deformation imaging seems at least equal, and perhaps superior, to LVEF measurement in the assessment of cardiac regenerative therapy. However, strategies varied substantially and call for a standardized approach.","2019-09-01","2021-12-15 07:13:07","2021-12-15 07:13:07","","1872-1882","","10","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Ltd","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/term.2937; http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/390207; http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31314949/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314949; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31314949/; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F390207; https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/31314949; https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/c79cb87b-78e1-3b37-a998-f9208b4b9091/","2D speckle tracking; coronary artery disease; deformation imaging; echocardiography; left ventricular ejection fraction; myocardial infarction; stem cells; strain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The optimal treatment of this complication is currently unknown. Experienced-based expert opinions have been produced, but a systematic review of published treatment studies is lacking. Goals To summarize and synthesize the published literature on the efficacy of treatments for GLILD in CVID. Methods We performed a systematic review using the PRISMA guidelines. Papers describing treatment and outcomes in CVID patients with radiographic and/or histologic evidence of GLILD were included. Treatment regimens and outcomes of treatment were summarized. Results 6124 papers were identified and 42, reporting information about 233 patients in total, were included for review. These papers described case series or small, uncontrolled studies of monotherapy with glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressants, rituximab monotherapy or rituximab plus azathioprine, abatacept, or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Treatment response rates varied widely. Cross-study comparisons were complicated because different treatment regimens, follow-up periods, and outcome measures were used. There was a trend towards more frequent GLILD relapses in patients treated with corticosteroid monotherapy when compared to rituximab-containing treatment regimens based on qualitative endpoints. HSCT is a promising alternative to pharmacological treatment of GLILD, because it has the potential to not only contain symptoms, but also to resolve the underlying pathology. However, mortality, especially among immunocompromised patients, is high. Conclusions We could not draw definitive conclusions regarding optimal pharmacological treatment for GLILD in CVID from the current literature since quantitative, well-controlled evidence was lacking. While HSCT might be considered a treatment option for GLILD in CVID, the risks related to the procedure are high. Our findings highlight the need for further research with uniform, objective and quantifiable endpoints. This should include international registries with standardized data collection including regular pulmonary function tests (with carbon monoxide-diffusion), uniform high-resolution chest CT radiographic scoring, and uniform treatment regimens, to facilitate comparison of treatment outcomes and ultimately randomized clinical trials.","2021-04-15","2021-12-15 07:13:07","2021-12-15 07:13:07","","606099-606099","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A.","","; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/treatment-strategies-for-glild-in-common-variable-immunodeficienc; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33936030/; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33936030; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai:pure.rug.nl:publications%2F68e5cab6-aa31-439a-bb25-f017f79a4b70; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8086379/; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8086379/; https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.606099/full","systematic review; common variable immunodeficiency; CVID; GLILD; granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease; immunodeficiency; treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This systematic review aimed at elucidating the prognostic role of gene expression profiles and at identifying gene signatures to predict clinical outcome. Methods: A systematic search of the Medline, Embase and the Cochrane library databases (2000-2015) was performed. Articles associating gene expression profiles in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma to survival, response to chemo(radio)therapy and/or lymph node metastasis were identified. Differentially expressed genes and gene signatures were extracted from each study and combined to construct a list of prognostic genes per outcome and histological tumor type. Results: This review includes a total of 22 studies. Gene expression profiles were related to survival in 9 studies, to response to chemo(radio)therapy in 7 studies, and to lymph node metastasis in 9 studies. The studies proposed many differentially expressed genes. However, the findings were heterogeneous and only 12 (ALDH1A3, ATR, BIN1, CSPG2, DOK1, IFIT1, IFIT3, MAL, PCP4, PHB, SPP1) of the 1.112 reported genes were identified in more than 1 study. Overall, 16 studies reported a prognostic gene signature, which was externally validated in 10 studies.

Although pneumococcal vaccination is highly recommended for those patients, the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination in this population remains largely unknown. Therefore, the objective of this PROSPERO-registered systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of the most commonly prescribed immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine, methotrexate, anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNFα), or rituximab, on the initial serologic response to pneumococcal vaccination in patients with auto-immune disease. Methods We included 22 articles comprising 2077 patients, of whom 1623 were treated with immunosuppressive agents, and 454 were controls. Results and discussion The findings of our systematic review indicate that, in patients treated with immunosuppressive medication and compared to controls, the initial serologic response to pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) are impaired. Moreover, this impaired response was more profound after PCV than after PPSV. We hypothesize that the immunosuppressive medication mainly compromises the cellular immunity, explaining the more severely reduced response rate to PCV (which induces a T-cell dependent immune response), compared to PPSV. Treatment with TNFα blocking agents was associated with a more favorable response, compared to patients treated with other immunosuppressive medication.

We systematically searched MEDLINE/PubMed and the EMBASE database, using the PRISMA guidelines, for eligible clinical trials. In total, 2330 records were screened, from which we have included 106 articles. A meta-analysis could be performed on 51 articles which describe the targeting of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway, and three articles which describe the targeting of hyaluronic acid. Anti-VEGF therapies did not show an increase in median overall survival (OS) with combined hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.01 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90–1.13). Treatment with hyaluronidase PEGPH20 showed promising results, but, thus far, only in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in selected patients with hyaluronic acid (HA)high tumors: An increase in median progression free survival (PFS) of 2.9 months, as well as a HR of 0.51 (95% CI 0.26–1.00). In conclusion, we found that anti-angiogenic therapies did not show an increased benefit in median OS or PFS in contrast to promising results with anti-hyaluronic acid treatment in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. The PEGPH20 clinical trials used patient selection to determine eligibility based on tumor biology, which underlines the importance to personalize treatment for pancreatic cancer patients.","2019-04-26","2021-12-15 07:13:08","2021-12-15 07:13:08","","588","","5","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/31035512; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.amc.nl%3Apublications%2F2c76af9f-c6b2-4d57-9aef-ac05545bacb2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035512; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31035512/; https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/11/5/588; https://repub.eur.nl/pub/117878/RePub-117878-OA.pdf; https://repub.eur.nl/pub/117878; https://research.vumc.nl/en/publications/clinical-trials-targeting-the-stroma-in-pancreatic-cancer-a-syste; https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/11/5/588/pdf; https://core.ac.uk/download/224788101.pdf","systematic review; clinical trial; PDAC; stroma; targeted therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since its first appearance in the medical literature in 1832, numerous cases have been described. The aim of this article is to provide the first comprehensive overview of published cases of Brodie's abscess, and to describe diagnostic methods, therapeutic consequences and outcomes. Methods: According to PRISMA guidelines a systematic review of the literature was performed. All published data in English or Dutch were considered for inclusion with no limitations on publication date. Data was extracted on demography, duration of symptoms, signs of inflammation, diagnostic imaging, causative agent, treatment and follow-up. Results: A total of 70 articles were included, reporting on a total of 407 patients, mostly young (median age 17) males (male:female ratio 2.1:1). The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 12 weeks (SD 26). Mostly consisting of pain (98%) and/or swelling (53%). 84% of all patients were afebrile, and less than 50% had elevated serum inflammation markers. Diagnosis was made with a combination of imaging modalities: plain X-ray in 96%, MRI (16%) and CT-scan (8%). Treatment consisted of surgery in 94% of the cases, in conjunction with long term antibiotics in 77%. Staphylococcus aureus was the pathogen most often found in the culture (67,3%). Outcome was generally reported as favorable. Recurrence was reported in 15,6% of the cases requiring further intervention. Two cases developed permanent disability. Conclusion: Brodie's abscess has an insidious onset as systemic inflammatory signs and symptoms were often not found. Treatment consisted mostly of surgery followed by antibiotics (77%) or only surgery (17%) and outcomes were generally reported as favourable.","2019-01-24","2021-12-15 07:13:08","2021-12-15 07:13:08","","33-39","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Germany Publisher: Copernicus GmbH","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30755846/; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755846; http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/381392; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6367194; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30755846; https://jbji.copernicus.org/articles/4/33/2019/jbji-4-33-2019.pdf; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F381392; https://jbji.copernicus.org/articles/4/33/2019/","systematic review; Brodie's abscess; case report; osteomyelitis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Assessment of monoamine levels over the circadian cycle, during different sleep stages and during SD is instrumental to understand the molecular dynamics during and after SD. To provide a complete overview of all available evidence, we performed a systematic review. A comprehensive search was performed for microdialysis and certain monoamines (dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, adrenaline), certain monoamine metabolites (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)) and a precursor (5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)) in PubMed and EMBASE. After screening of the search results by two independent reviewers, 94 publications were included. All results were tabulated and described qualitatively. Network-meta analyses (NMAs) were performed to compare noradrenaline and serotonin concentrations between sleep stages. We further present experimental monoamine data from the medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC). Monoamine levels varied with brain region and circadian cycle. During sleep, monoamine levels generally decreased compared to wake. These qualitative observations were supported by the NMAs: noradrenaline and serotonin levels decreased from wakefulness to slow wave sleep and decreased further during Rapid Eye Movement sleep. In contrast, monoamine levels generally increased during SD, and sometimes remained high even during subsequent recovery. Decreases during or after SD were only reported for serotonin. In our experiment, SD did not affect any of the mPFC monoamine levels. Concluding, monoamine levels vary over the light-dark cycle and between sleep stages. SD modifies the patterns, with effects sometimes lasting beyond the SD period.","2019-01-14","2021-12-15 07:13:08","2021-12-15 07:13:08","","1-32","","1","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United Kingdom Publisher: BioMed Central","","; ; ; ; ","https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F377905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671123; https://www.jcircadianrhythms.com/article/10.5334/jcr.174/; http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/377905; https://dx.doi.org/10.5334/jcr.174","Systematic review; circadian rhythm; microdialysis; monoamines; network meta-analysis; sleep deprivation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three studies found no significant difference between both surgical approaches (p = 0.871, p = 0.120, p = 0.592). Three other studies found a lower rate of POH in the TL group compared to the RS group (p = 0.019, p < 0.001, p < 0.001). Another study showed a significantly lower POH rate in the TL group after one and six months (p = 0.006), but not after 1 year (p = 0.6). The results of this systematic review show some evidence of a lower rate of POH in favor of the TL approach versus the RS approach for CPA tumor resection.

The present study aimed to assess outcomes of sternovertebral fracture treatment. A systematic review of literature on the treatment of traumatic sternovertebral fractures was conducted. Original studies published after 1990, reporting sternal and spinal healing or stability were included. Studies not reporting treatment outcomes were excluded. Six studies were included in this review, with a total study population of 98 patients: 2 case series, 3 case reports, and 1 retrospective cohort study. 10 per cent of sternal fractures showed displacement. Most spinal fractures were located in the thoracic spine and were AOSpine type A (51%), type B (35%), or type C (14%). 14 per cent of sternal fractures and 49% of spinal fractures were surgically treated. Sternal treatment failure occurred in 5% of patients and biomechanical spinal failure in 8%. There were no differences in treatment failure between conservative and operative treatment. Literature on traumatic sternovertebral fracture treatment is sparse. Findings indicate that in most patients, sternal fixation is not required to achieve sternal and spinal stability.

However, poor conduct or reporting of SRs and MAs may reduce their utility. The PRISMA Statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) was developed to help authors report their SRs and MAs adequately. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to (1) evaluate the quality of reporting of SRs and MAs and their abstracts in otorhinolaryngologic literature using the PRISMA and PRISMA for Abstracts checklists, respectively, (2) compare the quality of reporting of SRs and MAs published in Ear Nose Throat (ENT) journals to the quality of SRs and MAs published in the 'gold standard' Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and (3) formulate recommendations to improve reporting of SRs and MAs in ENT journals. METHODS: On September 3, 2014, we searched the Pubmed database using a combination of filters to retrieve SRs and MAs on otorhinolaryngologic topics published in 2012 and 2013 in the top 5 ENT journals (ISI Web of Knowledge 2013) or CDSR and relevant articles were selected. We assessed how many, and which, PRISMA (for Abstracts) items were reported adequately per journal type. RESULTS: We identified large differences in the reporting of individual items between the two journal types with room for improvement. In general, SRs and MAs published in ENT journals (n = 31) reported a median of 54.4% of the PRISMA items adequately, whereas the 49 articles published in the CDSR reported a median of 100.0 adequately (difference statistically significant, p < 0.001). For abstracts, medians of 41.7% for ENT journals and 75.0% for the CDSR were found (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The reporting of SRs and MAs in ENT journals leaves room for improvement and would benefit if the PRISMA Statement were endorsed by these journals.","2015-08-28","2021-12-15 07:13:08","2021-12-15 07:13:08","","e0136540","","8","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: Public Library of Science","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/332617; https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0136540; http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PLoSO..1036540P/abstract; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F332617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4552785; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136540; https://paperity.org/p/73917981/reporting-quality-of-systematic-reviews-and-meta-analyses-of-otorhinolaryngologic; http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4552785; http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136540","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Concurrently, they have the lowest number of physicians. Innovative methods such as the exchange of health-related information using mobile devices (mHealth) may support health care workers in the provision of antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes in LMICs. Objective: We conducted a systematic review evaluating the effectiveness of mHealth interventions targeting health care workers to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes in LMIC. Methods: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Global Health Library, and Popline were searched using predetermined search and indexing terms. Quality assessment was performed using an adapted Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. A strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat analysis was performed for each included paper. Results: A total of 19 studies were included for this systematic review, 10 intervention and 9 descriptive studies. mHealth interventions were used as communication, data collection, or educational tool by health care providers primarily at the community level in the provision of antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care. Interventions were used to track pregnant women to improve antenatal and delivery care, as well as facilitate referrals. None of the studies directly assessed the effect of mHealth on maternal and neonatal mortality. Challenges of mHealth interventions to assist health care workers consisted mainly of technical problems, such as mobile network coverage, internet access, electricity access, and maintenance of mobile phones. Conclusions: mHealth interventions targeting health care workers have the potential to improve maternal and neonatal health services in LMICs. However, there is a gap in the knowledge whether mHealth interventions directly affect maternal and neonatal outcomes and future research should employ experimental designs with relevant outcome measures to address this gap.

We searched MEDLINE and Embase databases (from inception to January 2020). Two authors independently screened references, performed data extraction, and critical appraisal. Randomized trials and comparative observational studies were eligible for inclusion. Criteria developed by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) group were used for critical appraisal. Besides the primary outcome (inappropriate PPI prescription or use), secondary outcomes included (adverse) pharmaceutical effects and healthcare use. We included ten studies in this review. Most de-implementation strategies contained an educational component (meetings and/or materials), combined with either clinical guideline implementation (n = 5), audit feedback (n = 3), organizational culture (n = 4), or reminders (n = 1). One study evaluating the de-implementation strategy effectiveness showed a significant reduction (RR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03–0.55) of new inappropriate PPI prescriptions. Out of five studies evaluating the effectiveness of de-implementing inappropriate PPI use, four found a significant reduction (RR 0.21; 95% CI 0.18–0.26 to RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.68–0.86). No significant differences in the occurrence of pharmaceutical effects (n = 1) and in length of stay (n = 3) were observed. Adverse pharmaceutical effects were reported in two studies and five studies reported on PPI or total drug costs.

In this study, we conducted a systematic review to examine processes, progress, outcomes, and challenges of harmonization/interaction initiatives between HTA bodies and regulatory agencies. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the International Pharmaceutical Abstracts database were searched up to 21 October 2019. Searches for gray literature (working papers, commissioned reports, policy documents, etc.) were performed via Google scholar and several institutional websites. An online cross-sectional survey was also conducted among HTA (n = 22) and regulatory agencies (n = 6) across Europe to supplement the systematic review. Overall, we found that while there are areas of divergence, there has been progress over time in narrowing the gap in evidentiary requirements for HTA bodies and regulatory agencies. Most regulatory agencies (4/6; 67%) and half (11/22, 50%) of the HTA bodies reported having a formal link for ""collaborating"" with the other. Several mechanisms such as early tripartite dialogues, parallel submissions (reviews), adaptive licensing pathways, and postauthorization data generation have been explored as avenues for improving collaboration. A number of pilot initiatives have shown positive effects of these models to reduce the time between regulatory and HTA decisions, which may translate into faster access for patients to life-saving therapies. Thus, future approaches aimed at improving harmonization/interaction between HTA bodies and regulatory agencies should build on these existing models/mechanisms while examining their long-term impacts. Several barriers including legal, organizational, and resource-related factors were also identified, and these need to be addressed to achieve greater alignment in the current regulatory and reimbursement landscape.","2020-10-16","2021-12-15 07:13:08","2021-12-15 07:13:08","","582634-582634","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: Frontiers Media SA","","; ; ; ; ","https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33178721; https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2020.582634/full; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7596325; https://doaj.org/article/7babf9c46e814066a668254caacbc14b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33178721","collaboration synergy between HTA and regulatory agencies; harmonization; HTA; regulatory approval; synergy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As escape rooms are increasingly popular in education, there is a need to evaluate their use, and a need for guidelines to develop and implement escape rooms in the classroom. This systematic review synthesizes current practices and experiences, focussing on important educational and game design aspects. Subsequently, relations between the game design aspects and the educational aspects are studied. Finally, student outcomes are related to the intended goals. Educators in different disciplines appear to have different motives for using the game’s time constraints and teamwork. These educators make different choices for related game aspects such as the structuring of the puzzles. Unlike recreational escape rooms, in educational escape rooms players need to reach the game goal by achieving the educational goals. More alignment in game mechanics and pedagogical approaches is recommended. There is a discrepancy in perceived and actual learning of content knowledge in recreational escape rooms. Recommendations in the article for developing and implementing escape rooms in education will help educators in creating these new learning environments, and eventually help students to foster knowledge and skills more effectively.","2020","2021-12-15 07:13:09","2021-12-15 07:13:09","","100364","","","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands Publisher: Elsevier BV","","; ; ","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1747938X20300531; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1747938X20300531; https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR116978","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis combining human and animal studies to assess whether prenatal amino acid (AA) supplementation could be a promising approach to promote healthy fetal growth. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane libraries were searched to identify studies orally supplementing the following AA groups during gestation: (1) arginine family; (2) branched chain (BCAA); (3) methyl donors. Primary outcome was fetal/birth weight. 22 human and 89 animal studies were included in the systematic review. The arginine family, and especially arginine itself, was studied most. Our meta-analysis showed beneficial effects of arginine and (N-Carbamyl) glutamate (NCG), but not aspartic acid and citrulline on fetal/birth weight. However, no effects were reported when isonitrogenous control diet was included. BCAA and methyl donor supplementation did not affect fetal/birth weight. Arginine family supplementation, in particular arginine and NCG, improves fetal growth in complicated pregnancies. BCAA and methyl donor supplementation do not seem to be as promising to target fetal growth. Well controlled research in complicated pregnancies is needed before ruling out AA supplements or preferring arginine above other AAs.","2020-08-21","2021-12-15 07:13:09","2021-12-15 07:13:09","","1-55","","9","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7551332; https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/9/2535/pdf; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.rug.nl%3Apublications%2F7032ffa8-bfca-451f-b4e8-4e340d8a371d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32825593; https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/225492; https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/9/2535; https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/prenatal-amino-acid-supplementation-to-improve-fetal-growth-a-sys","meta-analysis; amino acids; arginine; birth weight; branched chain amino acid; fetal growth restriction; methyl donor; pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For many tasks - including but not limited to systematic reviews and meta-analyses - the scientific literature needs to be checked systematically. Currently, scholars and practitioners screen thousands of studies by hand to determine which studies to include in their review or meta-analysis. This is error prone and inefficient because of extremely imbalanced data: only a fraction of the screened studies is relevant. The future of systematic reviewing will be an interaction with machine learning algorithms to deal with the enormous increase of available text. We therefore developed an open source machine learning-aided pipeline applying active learning: ASReview. We demonstrate by means of simulation studies that ASReview can yield far more efficient reviewing than manual reviewing, while providing high quality. Furthermore, we describe the options of the free and open source research software and present the results from user experience tests.

Using meta-regression, we found that the relation between neighbourhoods and individual educational outcomes is a function of neighbourhood poverty, the neighbourhood’s educational climate, the proportion of ethnic/migrant groups, and social disorganisation in the neighbourhood. The variance in the findings from different studies can partly be explained by the sampling design and the type of model used in each study.

Recent investigations have demonstrated that tumors may receive inadequate doses of radioactivity after radioembolization, due to unfavorable tumor to non-tumor (T/N) uptake ratios of radioactive microspheres. Hepatic arterial infusion of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (AT-II) is reported to increase the T/N blood flow ratio. The purpose of this systematic review was to provide a comprehensive overview of the effect of hepatic arterial AT-II on T/N blood flow ratio in patients with hepatic malignancies, and determine its clinical value for radioembolization. Methods This review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A structured search was performed in the PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases. Only studies that presented data on T/N ratios before and after infusion of AT-II into the hepatic artery, in human patients with hepatic malignancies, were selected. Median T/N ratios before, during and after AT-II infusion, and the median T/N ratio improvement factor were extracted from the selected articles. All data on systemic blood pressure measurements and clinical symptoms were also extracted. Results The search identified 524 titles of which 5 studies, including a total of 71 patients were considered relevant. Median T/N ratios before infusion of AT-II ranged from 0.4 to 3.4. All studies observed a substantial improvement of the T/N ratio after AT-II infusion, with median improvement factors ranging from 1.8 to 3.1. A transitory increase of systemic blood pressure was observed during AT-II infusion. Conclusions Infusion of AT-II into the hepatic artery leads to an increase of the tumor to non-tumor blood flow ratio, as measured by T/N uptake ratios. Clinical trials are warranted to assess safety aspects, optimal administration strategy and impact on treatment efficacy during radioembolization.","2014-01-17","2021-12-15 07:13:09","2021-12-15 07:13:09","","e86394","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: Public Library of Science","","; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24466071/; http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3895031; https://paperity.org/p/60617451/the-effect-of-intra-arterial-angiotensin-ii-on-the-hepatic-tumor-to-non-tumor-blood-flow; http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0086394; http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PLoSO...986394V/abstract; https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0086394; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24466071","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We included case–control and cohort studies that examined triglycerides, high/low density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol and homocysteine in women with sPTD. Articles were subdivided in pre-pregnancy, first, second and third trimester. Of 708 articles reviewed for eligibility, 14 met our inclusion criteria. Nine cohort studies and five case–control studies were analyzed, reporting on 1466 cases with sPTD and 11296 controls with term delivery. The studies suggest a possible elevated risk of sPTD in woman with high TG levels, no association of high and low density lipoprotein cholesterol with the risk of sPTD was found. High homocysteine levels are associated with sPTD in the second trimester. The role of triglycerides and homocysteine in sPTD should be explored further.","2016-11-02","2021-12-15 07:13:09","2021-12-15 07:13:09","","313-323","","2","295","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Germany Publisher: Springer Verlag","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://researchinformation.amsterdamumc.org/en/publications/maternal-lipid-profile-and-the-relation-with-spontaneous-preterm-; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00404-016-4216-5; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00404-016-4216-5.pdf; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5281656; https://paperity.org/p/78124699/maternal-lipid-profile-and-the-relation-with-spontaneous-preterm-delivery-a-systematic; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27807624/; http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/350299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5281656; https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/1446720; https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F350299; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/27807624","Preterm birth; Cholesterol; Homocysteine; Lipids; Preterm delivery; Triglycerides","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For drugs with more than two comparisons, both models predicted the direction of the effect regarding HbA1c levels. There were no differences between the db/db mouse and ZDF rat, except for exenatide (P = 0.02) and GLP-1 agonists (P = 0.03) in which a larger effect size was calculated in the ZDF rat. Our results indicate the differences between the db/db mouse and ZDF rat are not relevant for preliminary efficacy testing.

A large number of studies on many different wearable devices have been reported in recent years, but a systematic review is not yet available to date. Objective: The aim of this study was to provide a systematic review for health care professionals regarding the current evidence about the validation, feasibility, clinical outcomes, and costs of wearable wireless devices for continuous monitoring of vital signs. Methods: A systematic and comprehensive search was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 2009 to September 2019 for studies that evaluated wearable wireless devices for continuous monitoring of vital signs in adults. Outcomes were structured by validation, feasibility, clinical outcomes, and costs. Risk of bias was determined by using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool, quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2nd edition, or quality of health economic studies tool. Results: In this review, 27 studies evaluating 13 different wearable wireless devices were included. These studies predominantly evaluated the validation or the feasibility outcomes of these devices. Only a few studies reported the clinical outcomes with these devices and they did not report a significantly better clinical outcome than the standard tools used for measuring vital signs. Cost outcomes were not reported in any study. The quality of the included studies was predominantly rated as low or moderate. Conclusions: Wearable wireless continuous monitoring devices are mostly still in the clinical validation and feasibility testing phases. To date, there are no high quality large well-controlled studies of wearable wireless devices available that show a significant clinical benefit or cost-effectiveness. Such studies are needed to help health care professionals and administrators in their decision making regarding implementation of these devices on a large scale in clinical practice or in-home monitoring.","2020-06-17","2021-12-15 07:13:09","2021-12-15 07:13:09","","e18636","","6","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Canada Publisher: Journal of medical Internet Research","","; ; ; ; ; ","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/18636; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7351263; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32469323/; https://www.jmir.org/2020/6/e18636; http://europepmc.org/article/MED/32469323; https://doaj.org/article/1c4a8faa80a245aaa05ce5005b226b6c","systematic review; clinical deterioration; continuous monitoring; early deterioration; monitoring; patient monitoring; vital signs; wearable wireless device","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This systematic review evaluates the diagnostic value of MR imaging in children with an ovarian mass. The review was made according to the PRISMA Statement. PubMed and EMBASE were systematically searched for studies on the use of MR imaging in differential diagnosis of ovarian masses in both adult women and children from 2008 to 2018. Sixteen paediatric and 18 adult studies were included. In the included studies, MR imaging has shown good diagnostic performance in differentiating between benign and malignant ovarian masses. MR imaging techniques including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging seem to further improve the diagnostic performance. The addition of DWI with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values measured in enhancing components of solid lesions and DCE imaging may further increase the good diagnostic performance of MR imaging in the pre-operative differentiation between benign and malignant ovarian masses by increasing specificity. Prospective age-specific studies are needed to confirm the high diagnostic performance of MR imaging in children and adolescents with a sonographically indeterminate ovarian mass. • MR imaging, based on several morphological features, is of good diagnostic performance in differentiating between benign and malignant ovarian masses. Sensitivity and specificity varied between 84.8 to 100% and 20.0 to 98.4%, respectively. • MR imaging techniques like diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging seem to improve the diagnostic performance. • Specific studies in children and adolescents with ovarian masses are required to confirm the suggested increased diagnostic performance of DWI and DCE in this population.","2019-09-16","2021-12-15 07:13:09","2021-12-15 07:13:09","","1166-1181","","2","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Germany Publisher: Springer Verlag","","; ; ; ; ; ; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6957553; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31529256/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31529256; http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/392538; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00330-019-06420-4.pdf; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31529256; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00330-019-06420-4","Systematic review; Magnetic resonance imaging; Ovarian neoplasms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Purpose In this systematic review we aimed to determine whether continuous non-invasive respiratory monitoring improves early diagnosis of patient deterioration and reduces critical incidents on hospital wards. Data Sources Studies were retrieved from Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane library, searched from 1970 till October 25, 2014. Study Selection Electronic databases were searched using keywords and corresponding synonyms ‘ward’, ‘continuous’, ‘monitoring’ and ‘respiration’. Pediatric, fetal and animal studies were excluded. Data Extraction Since no validated tool is currently available for diagnostic or intervention studies with continuous monitoring, methodological quality was assessed with a modified tool based on modified STARD, CONSORT, and TREND statements. Data Synthesis Six intervention and five diagnostic studies were included, evaluating the use of eight different devices for continuous respiratory monitoring. Quantitative data synthesis was not possible because intervention, study design and outcomes differed considerably between studies. Outcomes estimates for the intervention studies ranged from RR 0.14 (0.03, 0.64) for cardiopulmonary resuscitation to RR 1.00 (0.41, 2.35) for unplanned ICU admission after introduction of continuous respiratory monitoring, Limitations The methodological quality of most studies was moderate, e.g. ‘before-after’ designs, incomplete reporting of primary outcomes, and incomplete clinical implementation of the monitoring system. Conclusions Based on the findings of this systematic review, implementation of routine continuous non-invasive respiratory monitoring on general hospital wards cannot yet be advocated as results are inconclusive, and methodological quality of the studies needs improvement. Future research in this area should focus on technology explicitly suitable for low care settings and tailored alarm and treatment algorithms.","2015-12-14","2021-12-15 07:13:10","2021-12-15 07:13:10","","e0144626","","12","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: United States Publisher: Public Library of Science","","; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ","https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144626; http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PLoSO..1044626V/abstract; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26658343/; http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/332793; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4684230/; https://europepmc.org/article/MED/26658343; https://core.ac.uk/display/150032266; https://paperity.org/p/74748243/non-invasive-continuous-respiratory-monitoring-on-general-hospital-wards-a-systematic; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0144626","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Study Design and Setting Two reviewers systematically searched and selected ischemic stroke models. Risk of bias was assessed with the PROBAST. Predictive performance was evaluated within The Netherlands Cooperative Study on the Adequacy of Dialysis (NECOSAD), a large prospective multicenter cohort of incident dialysis patients. For discrimination, c-statistics were calculated; calibration was assessed by plotting predicted and observed probabilities for stroke, and calibration-in-the-large. Results Seventy-seven prediction models for stroke were identified, of which 15 were validated. Risk of bias was high, with all of these models scoring high risk in one or more domains. In NECOSAD, of the 1,955 patients, 127 (6.5%) suffered an ischemic stroke during the follow-up of 2.5 years. Compared with the original studies, most models performed worse with all models showing poor calibration and discriminative abilities (c-statistics ranging from 0.49 to 0.66). The Framingham showed reasonable calibration; however, with a c-statistic of 0.57 (95% CI 0.50–0.63), the discrimination was poor. Conclusion This external validation demonstrates the weak predictive performance of ischemic stroke models in incident dialysis patients. Instead of using these models in this fragile population, either existing models should be updated, or novel models should be developed and validated.","2020-03-30","2021-12-15 07:13:10","2021-12-15 07:13:10","","69-79","","","123","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands Publisher: Elsevier USA","","; ; ; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32240769; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089543562030072X; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32240769/; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32240769","Systematic review; External validation; Calibration; Discrimination; Incident dialysis; Ischemic stroke; Prediction model; Predictive performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent investigations have demonstrated that tumors may receive inadequate doses of radioactivity after radioembolization, due to unfavorable tumor to non-tumor (T/N) uptake ratios of radioactive microspheres. Hepatic arterial infusion of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (AT-II) is reported to increase the T/N blood flow ratio. The purpose of this systematic review was to provide a comprehensive overview of the effect of hepatic arterial AT-II on T/N blood flow ratio in patients with hepatic malignancies, and determine its clinical value for radioembolization.This review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A structured search was performed in the PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases. Only studies that presented data on T/N ratios before and after infusion of AT-II into the hepatic artery, in human patients with hepatic malignancies, were selected. Median T/N ratios before, during and after AT-II infusion, and the median T/N ratio improvement factor were extracted from the selected articles. All data on systemic blood pressure measurements and clinical symptoms were also extracted.The search identified 524 titles of which 5 studies, including a total of 71 patients were considered relevant. Median T/N ratios before infusion of AT-II ranged from 0.4 to 3.4. All studies observed a substantial improvement of the T/N ratio after AT-II infusion, with median improvement factors ranging from 1.8 to 3.1. A transitory increase of systemic blood pressure was observed during AT-II infusion.Infusion of AT-II into the hepatic artery leads to an increase of the tumor to non-tumor blood flow ratio, as measured by T/N uptake ratios.
