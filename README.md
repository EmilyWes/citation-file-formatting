## Introduction
//Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.
Also, introduction.//

There are many software solutions and tools that allow you to manage your scientific work. Often times, you need to use multiple solutions to cover your whole workflow. This is where things get interesting but also confusing. Some tools just do not work well with others.

In this open repository, we have tried to simplify the process of setting up a scientific workflow for research. We have described the interrelations between citation and reference managers, search engines and systematic review software.

## Usage
//The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.//

### File Formats
### Citation and Reference Managers
### Search Engines
### Systematic Review software
Describe the file formats and the software.
Describe the relations between formats and software.

### Compatibility
Below, you can find a table outlining import/export capabilities of previously described software. Namely, different file formats commonly used within the field of scientific referencing are described.

Guide for using the table:
* Search for the software (e.g **ASReview**) you are interested in;
* Follow the line, until you find the file format(e.g **.ris**) you are interested in;
* Within the file format field, *Import from ...* is indicated on the left side, *Export to ...* on the right side;
* :green_square: indicates success and :red_square: indicates failure;

> Example: :green_square::red_square:
> 
> Meaning: Software can import from but not export to the given file format.

## Contributing
//Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to help others contribute, check out the guide for setting guidelines for repository contributors.//

## Credits
//Include a section for credits in order to highlight and link to the authors of your project.//

## License
//Finally, include a section for the license of your project. For more information on choosing a license, check out GitHub’s licensing guide!//
