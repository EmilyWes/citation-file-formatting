## What?
Before we get into how to exactly contribute, let's look at what you can actually do.

### Documentation
First and foremost, this repository is for simplifing the process of setting up a scientific workflow for research. In case you find something that could be simplified further, do not hesitate to work on it. Also, improving documentation is often the quickest way to start contributing.

### Datasets
We have described the interrelations between popular citation and reference managers, search engines and systematic review software. Additionally, we have gathered [relevant datasets](Datasets/) to show capabilities of each tool more specifically.
